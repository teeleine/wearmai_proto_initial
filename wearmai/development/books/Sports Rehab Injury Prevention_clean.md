# How to Use This Book

This book provides comprehensive overview of physiotherapy knowledge including case studies that frame clinical issues and evidence-based treatment and rehabilitation programs

# Case Study: Groin Discomfort in Sprinter

A 24-year-old male sprinter presented with left-sided groin discomfort following plyometric session three months prior to this consultation The discomfort has resulted in pain after every training session

# Symptoms

- Lower abdominal and medial anterior groin pain following activity progressively longer to improve with rest
- Pain becomes very low grade and almost unnoticeable with rest
- Irritable pain when coughing and sneezing
- Feels 'sore' in the groin when sitting upright for while
- Pain in the deep inner groin when squeezing the legs together particularly in bed

Pain was described as exercise-related and variable between 1 and 7 on 10-point scale There were minimal impingement signs with hip flexion-adduction

On examination the left side appeared more tender and dilated than the right with cough impulse The left adductor was relatively weaker than the right and painful in resisted adduction lying with straight legs but not with legs bent in flexion There was no discomfort on stretch Stork views of the pelvis standing on one leg and then the other excluded pelvic instability pubic symphysis and hip pathology

# Surgical Findings

The patient was referred to surgeon for opinion During surgery the following groin disruptions were identified:

- Torn external oblique aponeurosis
- Conjoined tendon torn from pubic tubercle
- Dehiscence between conjoined tendon and inguinal ligament

Each element of this groin disruption was repaired surgically

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Normal protocol for the first day post-operation included standing and walking with gentle stretching and stability exercises

# How to Use This Book

Five days post-operative ultrasound ascertained core stability to be poor and Transversus Abdominis activation (Cowan 2004) was achieved with practice using patient visualisation of the ultrasound real-time image for re-education

Adductor exercises (Figures 204–5) were encouraged one week post-op several times per day Closed chain exercises for stability (eg Figures 206–9) combined with slow controlled squats progressing to single leg squats were developed two weeks post-op with hydrotherapy for flexibility and stability Swimming cycling and cross-trainer elliptical exercise developed in the third week After four weeks he started straight line running build ups alternate days

# Conclusion

This athlete returned to relatively full training after two months and competed internationally six months after the surgery

# Discussion

- At what time should an athlete with groin discomfort be referred to surgeon to consider operative intervention?
- Should longer period of conservative treatment and rehabilitation take place before referral for surgery?
- Should the patient have been referred for other investigations eg ultrasound scan or MRI?
- What other areas of the may contribute towards this athlete's injury?

In summary the contents of this book are designed to evoke clinical decisions based on research evidence The chapters are sequenced to allow the reader to develop an appreciation for understanding and analysing clinical practice and actions Individually the chapters provide framework for conceptualising different scientific applications and practices but collectively they compendium of clinical knowledge cemented by clinical practice and framed within an evidence-based context

# Introduction and Aims

The popularity of physical activity in all of its forms continues to steadily increase More than just the domain of elite or professional athletes the populace enjoys variety of recreational pursuits from hiking and running to skiing and surfing from badminton and tennis to cricket and hockey In such endeavors many participants find that injury is inevitable Unfortunate circumstances are not confined to those engaging in rugby or “X games” daredevil sports like Parkour kitesurfing or acrobatic bicycle jumping although clearly these carry high cost in physical trauma (Young 2002; Spanjersberg and Schipper 2007; Miller and Demoiny 2008) Young footballers and senior golfers alike are prone to injury as are Olympic performers and “weekend warriors” because injury does not discriminate (Delaney et al 2009; Falvey et al 2009) Likewise non-traditional athletes such as dancers (Fitt 1996; Stretanski 2002; Koutedakis and Jamurtas 2004) will not escape injury (Bowling 1989; Garrick and Lewis 2001; Bronner Ojofeitimi and Spriggs 2003; Laws 2005)

Whether they are pursuing gold medals or leisure those who participate in physical activity require both proper preventive training and proper healthcare; they will benefit greatly from experts who can deliver these Sport rehabilitators and other allied health professionals have much to offer physically active people This chapter aims to:

- Define the role of the sport rehabilitator as member of the sport injury care team;
- Promote individual and organisational professionalism within the field of sport rehabilitation;
- Provide framework for ethical conduct of sport rehabilitators and related professionals;
- Describe legal parameters that must be considered by those in sport rehabilitation and related fields

# The Role of the Sport Rehabilitator

Preparing an individual to successfully participate in sport requires by its very nature expertise from multiple specialties Managing the injuries that occur to sport participants also requires from many specialists Thus at any given point the athlete may be surrounded by team of professionals including the coach club manager conditioning specialist biomechanist physiotherapist nutritionist exercise physiologist chiropodist chiropractor

# Figure 11: Diagram Showing the Breadth of Sport Injury Management

Note that in the situation of an athlete who is minor child the parents or carers become part of the management scenario

The management of sport injury is team activity and the sport rehabilitator plays key role The British Association of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers (BASRaT) administers the credential “Graduate Sport Rehabilitator” abbreviated as “GSR” According to this professional society “ Graduate Sport Rehabilitator is graduate level autonomous healthcare practitioner specializing in musculoskeletal management exercise-based rehabilitation and fitness” (British Association of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers 2009b)

# Skill Domains of Graduate Sport Rehabilitator

- Professional responsibility and development
- Prevention
- Recognition and evaluation of the individual
- Management of the individual – therapeutic intervention rehabilitation and performance enhancement
- Immediate care

While prevention of injury is certainly desirable the reality that athletes will be injured is part of sport participation Thus the sport rehabilitator must always be prepared to administer the care for which they are trained The ideal place to begin providing this care is pitchside or courtside where the circumstances surrounding the injury have been observed and evaluation of the injury can be performed prior to the onset of complicating factors such as muscle spasm Any sport rehabilitator who expects to offer this type of care must possess the proper qualification and additional credentials to support it

The abilities of sport rehabilitator include cardiopulmonary resuscitation first aid blood-borne pathogen safeguards strapping and bracing and practical experience in proper clinical education program with various traumatic injuries that accompany sport participation Working with certain sports such as cricket ice hockey and North American football requires specialized understanding of protective equipment and how to administer care in emergency situations when the injured athlete is encumbered by such equipment

BASRaT’s (2009b) Role Delineation of the Sport Rehabilitator document details the implementation of the skill domains listed above into scope of practice The components of each domain are further subdivided into knowledge components and skill components to create framework for the education of sport rehabilitators and the extent of their capabilities to serve as healthcare professionals

A brief introduction to similar type of sport healthcare provider in the United States of America is useful here as comparison Certified Athletic Trainers (denoted by the qualification “ATC”) are “health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients Athletic training encompasses the prevention diagnosis and intervention of emergency acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment functional limitations and disabilities” (National Athletic Trainers’ Association 2009b) The National Athletic Trainers’ Association the professional of Certified Athletic Trainers has existed since 1950 Standards of practice are set and certification examination is administered by the Board of Certification (2009) to ensure that the profession is properly regulated Most individual states in the USA also require possession of license in order to practice as an athletic trainer

# Delineation Skill Domains for Sport Rehabilitators

The requisite skills of Certified Athletic Trainers are categorized into 13 content areas (National Athletic Trainers’ Association 2009a):

1 Foundational behaviours of professional practice
2 Risk management and injury prevention
3 Pathology of injuries and illnesses
4 Orthopaedic clinical examination and diagnosis
5 Medical conditions and disabilities
6 Acute care of injuries and illnesses
7 Therapeutic modalities
8 Conditioning and rehabilitative exercise
9 Pharmacology
10 Psychosocial intervention and referral
11 Nutritional aspects of injuries and illnesses
12 Health care administration
13 Professional development and responsibility

These content areas define how Certified Athletic Trainers are educated and how they retain the ATC credential via continuing professional development hours (called continuing education in the USA with the participation increments called CEUs or continuing education units) As with Graduate Sport Rehabilitators accountability to such standards is imperative for sustaining the integrity of the profession

# Continuing Professional Development

There is no place pitchside for healthcare practitioners who cannot perform the required duties that arise under the pressure of managing injury during sporting competition Therefore fundamental responsibility of the sport rehabilitator – or any other healthcare practitioner – is to secure high standard in their education This encompasses the undergraduate and postgraduate courses and the motivation to embrace diligence and excellence in all required modules work placements internships and the like The knowledge required and tasks allowed for specific professional qualifications are usually dictated by professional organisations As mentioned above BASRaT holds sport rehabilitators to high standard of education

Once qualification is attained however another educational process ensues: professionals must engage in continuing professional development (CPD) The importance of this cannot be overstated CPD helps the sport rehabilitator not only maintain their skills but acquire new ones that broaden one’s ability to offer high-quality healthcare to athletes clients and patients Moreover knowledge in sport science and sport medicine is constantly evolving as further basic and applied research is undertaken Adequate CPD helps the sport rehabilitator stay abreast of these developments

CPD courses afford exciting opportunities for personal enrichment Many topics are germane to the field and veritable subculture exists to provide adequate chances for professionals to enlist in training courses that match every ability need and desire Most professional societies including BASRaT advise their members about suitable courses and the required quantity of CPD hours Advanced life support manual therapy pitchside emergency care strength training exercise testing specialised joint examinations rehabilitative exercise and management of non-orthopaedic injuries and conditions are only few topics representative of the wide gamut of offerings

A qualification in basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation for healthcare providers (ie BLS/AED – Basic Life Support/Automated External Defibrillation) is considered minimal credential that should be kept up to date by periodic skills retraining The Resuscitation Council (UK) and the European Resuscitation Council publish the appropriate standards for BLS and AED training (European Resuscitation Council 2009; Resuscitation Council (UK) 2009); the latter also maintains calendar of many life support courses offered around Europe including the United Kingdom

# Knowledge Ability and Wisdom

It is important for professional healthcare providers to distinguish amongst knowledge ability and wisdom These are distinct yet interrelated
---
# Ethical Considerations

# Ethical Considerations

Characteristics that all sport rehabilitators must strive for as they provide care to the public include:

- Knowledge: The learning and understanding of facts that the basis for practice It provides the information on which successful career is built
- Ability: The application of knowledge Knowledge is not useful until person accomplishes task by applying it
- Wisdom: The most difficult but significant characteristic to garner gained over time through experience It mixes knowledge and ability to elicit the best result in given circumstances

These three characteristics are fundamental to success and all healthcare professionals draw on each of them every day

# Ethics in Sport Rehabilitation

Ethics refers to set of concepts principles and laws that inform people’s moral obligation to behave with decency It is essential to protect individuals in vulnerable positions such as patients or clients in healthcare settings Each sport rehabilitator must consider themselves healthcare practitioner and therefore is under an ethical obligation for professional conduct

Sport medicine presents challenging parameters for applying an ethical framework due to the high public visibility of sport This visibility necessitates that sport rehabilitators ensure their practice falls under appropriate accountability

Unfortunately ethical dilemmas do not always lend themselves to clear objective resolutions; thus governing bodies codify guiding principles for conduct The Code of Ethics of the British Association of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers is an example of guidelines that promote proper behavior

In healthcare the field of ethics sets appropriate and acceptable standards to protect the public from damages incurred by unscrupulous or incompetent practitioners and the harmful effects of unwarranted or dangerous diagnostic or therapeutic interventions Respect for human dignity is paramount and healthcare practice must adhere to this high standard

# Challenges in Ethical Application

There are several circumstances in sport that can strain the typical application of ethics including:

- Decisions about return to sport activity with persisting injury
- Pharmaceutical therapies to assist participation
- Participation of children especially in high-risk sports
- Sharing of confidential athlete medical information among practitioners or between practitioners and public representatives such as the press
- Use of ergogenic aids such as anabolic steroids and blood doping

Of these treating an athlete’s medical information with confidentiality is likely to be the most difficult and frequently compromised particularly in the pitchside environment Competing challenges and pressures can create ethical dilemmas such as:

- The close proximity of an injured player to other players and coaches during examination
- The public visibility of an injury
- The interests of the sporting club and the desire of coaching staff to receive information about the injury
- The player’s desire to shield this information from coaches

Additional contemporary ethical challenges for practitioners caring for athletes include informed consent for care drug prescription and the use of innovative or emerging technologies

The most appropriate way for the sport rehabilitator to manage potentially difficult ethical predicaments is to practice diligently under an approved ethical code such as that of the British Association for Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers It is crucial to decide how individual ethical quandaries will be handled prior to being confronted by them The consequences of infractions can be severe resulting in revoked professional licenses registrations certifications and in particularly egregious cases the end of careers

# Legal Considerations in Sport Rehabilitation

# Legal Considerations

An additional concern when providing care to athletes is the increasingly litigious aura that pervades much of Western society Sport rehabilitators and other practitioners of sport injury care are subject to lawsuits brought by athletes and their representatives (eg parents carers) As previously mentioned consistently following an appropriate code of ethics and continually educating yourself via CPD are two ways to ameliorate the risk It is also crucial that sport injury professionals maintain malpractice and liability insurance cover caveat for which BASRaT ensures compliance of its member Graduate Sport Rehabilitators

The discussion of legal liability first needs directive citing the proper way of acting that is acknowledged by courts when deriving judgments “The man on the Clapham omnibus” is common phrase in English law that denotes person who acts truly and fairly (Glynn and Murphy 1996) with all faculties that would be expected under the circumstances (An American equivalent is “ reasonable and prudent person”) A structure of accountability is fundamental to the application of this concept Within given context it may be modified appropriately; healthcare is only one realm to which it pertains (Glynn and Murphy 1996) Whilst being afraid of the potential for litigation in sport healthcare environment would unnecessarily constrain well-qualified professional undeniably sport rehabilitators and other healthcare practitioners must be cognisant of the inherent risk of being sued for wrong actions (acts of commission) or for inaction when action is warranted (acts of omission) Instead of being intimidated one should take all necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of lawsuit as much as possible

The tenet of “public right to expertise” was proposed for the sport and physical education fields more than 25 years ago (Baker 1980 1981) The general concept states that members of the public have the right to expect that those who offer themselves as professionals in given field of endeavour are qualified as experts in that field In the context of sport rehabilitation affording the public this right is paramount because of the potential for severe consequences when healthcare providers are inadequately skilled or make errors in practice or judgement (Goodman 2001)

Countless legal cases transcend recent decades (Appenzeller 2005) as plaintiffs (people filing lawsuit) persist in claiming negligence by defendants (people being sued) such as healthcare providers coaches and institutions Generally negligence claim must show the following (Champion 2005):

- There is verifiable standard of care to which the defendant should be held
- The defendant had duty to care for the plaintiff
- The defendant breached their duty
- The plaintiff sustained damages or injury
- The damages or injury were caused by the defendant’s breach of the duty

Risk of exposure to legal liability related to healthcare in sport usually occurs in four main areas the first three of which are related to one another (Kane and White 2009):

1 Pre-participation physical examination: A screening process to evaluate the athlete’s physical and mental status prior to engaging in sport should be fundamental requirement before such engagement occurs
2 Determination of an athlete’s ability to participate: Whether confronted with signs and symptoms pitchside courtside in first aid facility in polyclinic or elsewhere proper decision making about an athlete’s fitness to participate must be made in accordance with current healthcare practice
3 Evaluation and care of significant injuries on the pitch or court: Healthcare professionals not only must be well-qualified they must deliver care that is appropriate for given situation Concussions spinal cord injuries and hyperthermia are three examples of injuries requiring urgent specialised diagnostic and treatment procedures A sponsoring club university school or organisation must ensure that plan is in place to adequately respond to emergency situations that may arise in sport

# Table 14: Some Examples of Negligence That Can Lead to Injury Litigation in Sport

|Area of Potential Negligence|Examples|
|---|---|
|Facility Safety|Poor condition of the surface of the pitch court track etc (eg holes uneven surfaces) Unsafe equipment (eg exposed sharp edges broken or rusted parts) Unsafe practices (eg reduced visibility if lights are not used when training held at night) Impeding objects that are not part of the sport activity|
|Warning of (or Unnecessary) Risk or Danger|Failure to teach safe techniques for the sport Failure to disclose potential injury consequences of playing and of not playing using safe techniques Failure to intervene when players do not use safe techniques Mismatched players (eg adult players participating together with young players)|
|Protective Equipment|Failure to provide proper protective equipment Failure to require use of protective equipment Improper fit of protective equipment|
|Documentation of Injury|Failure to maintain injury records Failure to maintain treatment and rehabilitation records Failure to maintain confidentiality of records Falsifying or altering medical records|
|Appropriate Care|Failure to follow proper care protocols Failure to refer injured player to healthcare professional of greater experience or higher qualification Failure to remove injured player from participation|

Disclosure of personal medical record information – Confidentiality is fundamental right and expectation of all patients and clients including athletes The sport rehabilitator must take care to not convey – even unwittingly – information about an athlete’s case to others without the athlete’s permission

Additional concerns for the sport rehabilitator that relate to potential injury circumstances in these general categories are accumulated in Table 14 (Anderson 2002; Champion 2005; Kane and White 2009)

Following review of pertinent legal cases Goodman (2001) corroborated that those who supervise teams could be liable if they or their sport healthcare providers failed to perform properly in any of these specific areas:

- Provide appropriate training instruction
- Maintain or purchase safe equipment
- Hire or supervise competent and responsible personnel
- Give adequate warning to participants concerning dangers inherent in sport
- Provide prompt and proper medical care
- Prevent the injured athlete from further competition that could aggravate an injury (Goodman 2001 p449)

Finally Konin and Frederick (2005 p38) identified six common mistakes sport healthcare providers make in caring for athletes; these are shown below and provide key areas for attention by sport rehabilitators:

1 Not establishing baseline (ie “normal” uninjured) data with respect to patient/athlete
2 Accidentally verbally breaching patient’s privacy
3 Not knowing rules and regulations related to confidentiality of patient information and medical records

# Conclusion

The sport rehabilitator is key member of the sport injury management team As such you must adhere to several important professional practical ethical and legal principles Properly equipping yourself to administer acute injury management in the venues where practice will be undertaken – whether pitchside courtside trackside in clinic or elsewhere – is vitally important However simply being prepared to deliver care required by sport participants does not sufficiently qualify sport rehabilitator or any other sport health professional for that matter Proper ethical and legal frameworks are integral to success as well Without these underpinnings the most skillful healthcare worker will not be able to sustain their practice under the guidelines deemed appropriate by civilized societies

In summary this entire textbook is devoted to ensuring the reader’s success in sport rehabilitation or related field It is welcome instructional resource to the student but it is valuable informational reference to the clinician too There is wealth of material presented where the authors offer insights from their knowledge abilities and wisdom in order to equip the reader for excellence in their career post

# Introduction

The main aims of this chapter are to introduce musculoskeletal screening and outline the available methods and the related reliability and validity issues This chapter will allow the reader to gain an understanding of musculoskeletal screening and its role in injury prevention identify the musculoskeletal screening methods available including discussion of the validity and reliability of screening methods The chapter will finally recommend screening procedure for injury risk identification

With the need for athletes to play an ever-increasing number of fixtures the enforced breaks due to injury need to be decreased Several approaches can be taken to ensure that the athlete is trained and prepared so that any possible problems are either dealt with before they arise or measures are in place so that treatment can be administered rapidly upon injury Injury prevention is process whereby the athlete is screened through variety of tests to identify any potential problems with their musculoskeletal composition These problems can then be identified and training practices put in place to either eradicate these problems or reduce their possible impact Several procedures are used by sports practitioners with varying degrees of success as the need for one common procedure for musculoskeletal screening becomes apparent Several researchers have attempted to identify which methods offer the highest degree of accuracy and validity (Gabbe et al 2004; Miller and Callister 2009; McClean et al 2005)

Pre-habilitation can often be overlooked in the makeup of sports support team which can often lead to problems being overlooked and the team or individual not performing to their potential throughout their season due to injury In contrast some professional clubs spend too much time on remedial level pre-habilitation and not enough time on high intensity training that meets the demands of the sport Procedures need to be implemented to ensure the amount of training days and competitive sessions missed are minimized Practitioners need to be proactive with their treatment plans and not rely on the traditional reactive plans In order for this to be the case practitioners need to be fully aware of the latest research and methods in the area of need through continued professional development These plans often commence during the offseason or the early part of pre-season During this period the athlete can be assessed without the demands of competition which will enable the practitioner to gain the knowledge needed to plan for the upcoming season

Screening can be completed through variety of tests including physical activity tests functional assessment and questionnaires These all have varying strengths and weaknesses and are also dependent on the practitioner who is carrying out the screening

# Injury Prevention and Screening

# Injury Prevention and Screening

Regardless of the method chosen the aim is to identify series of risk factors that will enable any potential problems to be identified and diagnosed The findings of the athlete screening can be assessed for risk of injury so that plans can be made to reduce the level of risk for the athlete

# Screening Methods

The approach taken by the leisure industry as whole towards injury prevention involves health screening questionnaire The questionnaire can often be modified to include few general musculoskeletal questions which if answered negatively can then result in the athlete being referred to their GP This GP referral approach is very general and mainly focuses on reducing liability for the administering facility or practitioner Although this approach would not be recommended when working with athletes in sport rehabilitation the use of questionnaire is often overlooked even though research has shown it to be useful screening tool

Research by Dawson et al (2009) suggests that through the use of the Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ-E) potential pain areas and consequential problems can be identified The questionnaire needs to be administered by suitable practitioner and not the athlete involved ensuring the results are valid Research indicated that in conjunction with relevant functional assessments this questionnaire was useful starting point in the screening process The results found that the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems could be correctly diagnosed and treated effectively The reliability of the questionnaire used was tested over series of trials with consistent results indicating validity and repeatability (Dawson et al 2009)

Figure 21 clearly shows the important areas of the so the athlete knows which part the questions are related to following logical order through the area identifying the degree of any possible pain The questions then follow logical order down the covering all the general points of the The results can then be passed on to sports rehabilitation practitioner for further focused functional assessment of the identified problem areas (Dawson et al 2009)

Assessment by means of questionnaire is not of course new methodology but the integration with functional and physical tests to holistic process is The way in which the screening elements are integrated into the injury prevention process can have large impact on the athletes involved If athletes feel part of this process they could take ownership and fully commit to the measures that are ultimately proposed If athletes are insufficiently involved they might see the process and resultant programme as unnecessary and therefore not worthy of expending too much energy on The other situation is where the athlete could learn too much and become demotivated about their long-term future in the sport resulting in lack of commitment The latter two scenarios may lead to the practitioners' plans failing and the problems identified could arise with negative effect on performance

A more simplistic approach to questionnaires can also produce good results in reducing the amount of tests that an athlete needs to perform The reduction of testing time is important in large squads as the amount of time the practitioner spends with the athlete reduces the amount of time the coach can spend working on sport-specific training Therefore the need to develop useful tool to identify the members of the squad who do not need any further testing or those who can be dealt with in reduced fashion is important The process shown in Figure 22 indicates simple pathway to group the squad into different levels of testing through simple set of questions This has been shown to be reliable in identifying conditions and more importantly not missing any problems The questionnaire again needs to be administered by practitioner to ensure the validity of the answers (Berg-Rice et al 2007)

When the screening questions shown in Figure 22 were completed by practitioner the potential injuries were correctly found in 92% of athletes screened When the same process was completed by non-practitioner only 80% of cases were positively screened Although the results of the screening process show that it needs to be conducted by the relevant practitioner the overall impact on the average number of days lost through injury was still similar: 23 days (non-screened) versus 21 days This suggests that stringent follow-up tests are still needed to ensure that problems are dealt with effectively (Berg-Rice et al 2007)

The initial questionnaire used for screening can also assess the athlete’s psychological state towards injury and the social factors that could affect their own approach to problems The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (OMPSQ) is one such tool that can be utilized

The OMPSQ has been used in research to look at potential problems and the subject’s pain avoidance The athlete’s injury history will have an effect on their ability to deal with injury and how they rate their current musculoskeletal state The OMPSQ factors into the score: fear avoidance; how well the person perceives they can deal with pain; how distressed they have been in the past about injuries; and the athlete’s own rating of their function These scores were then combined and factors given to the rating to produce three predicting factors of how many days the athlete will miss on average year The first predicting factor was the function group of questions which significantly ( = 0001) predicted the amount of ‘Sick’ days the athlete would have over the course of three-year period (Westman et al 2008) The functional assessment questions looked into how athletes perceived the injury affected them and their ability to perform The second factor that significantly predicted the amount of the missed training days due to problems was the pain factor The athletes’ pain and injury history was factored into this predictor to significantly predict the amount of days the athlete would miss during the next three years ( = 00026) (Westman et al 2008) The final factor in this questionnaire which was labelled fear-avoidance and was the pain that the athlete had experienced did not significantly predict the amount of missed training days The last factor included the athlete’s fear of training due to the perceived effect it would have on an injury

Figure 23 VAS characteristics (Laslett et al 2004) Reproduced with permission from Litcher-Kelly L Martion SA Broderick JE & Stone AA (2007) A systematic review of measures used to assess chronic musculoskeletal pain in clinical and randomized controlled clinical trials The journal of pain 8 (12) 906–913 copyright 2007 Elsevier

The scale by which athletes are often asked to report pain can be varied but the most reliable and most common is the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The characteristics of the VAS can be seen in Figure 23 The scale can have variety of anchor points and reporting periods The way in which it categorizes pain can also be varied with global intense and general terms all being used to interact with the patient to help them identify their pain There is need for ‘golden measure’ of assessment of patient pain and the VAS seems to be the most commonly used method at present (Litcher-Kelly et al 2007)

Functional assessments can follow screening questionnaire or be the injury prevention process in its entirety The test used to functionally assess an athlete can be varied and differ depending upon the area of the and the activity the athlete competes in The back and knee are two of the major areas that the screening process needs to assess due to their importance to locomotion and therefore the resultant sporting performance The flexibility and posture can be governed extensively by the back and in particular the lower back strength of the athlete If the athletes suffer from lower back pain (LBP) then they can often miss training sessions due to the lack of mobility or work at reduced level The importance to screen this area of the properly and plan for any potential problems is essential in an athlete’s sporting life

Revels model can be used as screening test for LBP with no specific conditions Athletes with specific LBP would need to be further screened to assess the full extent of their problems These findings were shown in research to be applicable for 11% of the population as the testing procedure lacked specificity (Laslett et al 2004) The Revels testing

The procedure involves the patient being asked to assess the back pain currently experienced using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) then the highest amount of pain and then the lowest amount of pain experienced Subjects were then asked to complete the exercises shown in Figure 24 On completion of the exercises the subjects were then asked to re-evaluate their pain scores on the VAS Using the Revels model the subjects were categorized into groups that had met the criteria and those that had not The groups that had met the criteria had further assessment on the lower back joints As previously stated this only produced positive result in those subjects with very general problems but was significantly linked ( = 004) to the patients' amount of 'sick days' ie those with positive Revels test had greater number of 'sick days' (Laslett et al 2004)

The safety of tests like the Revels model has been questioned due to the danger imposed by possible further damage to existing injuries The condition of most concern is vertebral artery dissection (VAD) When assessing the back practitioners must ensure that the patient’s history is fully recorded before examination ruling out any symptoms for VAD The patient should be assessed initially by means of non-provocative manipulation If the area of the cervical spine needs to be manipulated then the practitioner should ensure that all symptoms for VAD have been eliminated and decide whether the provocative manipulation results are necessary or conclusions can be drawn through other means (Thiel and Rix 2005)

Another area on the that is of paramount importance to the practitioner is the knee An injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most serious problems that can happen to an athlete and can have serious effect on their career (Bonci 1999) The prevention of injury to the ACL and the knee is very important and is dependent on identifying series of risk factors The major risk factors associated with ACL injuries include lower extremity malalignments ligamentous laxity lower extremity muscular strength considerations neuromuscular control hormonal influences intercondylar notch width and the biomechanics of the athletes’ sporting techniques (Bonci 1999)

The rehabilitator can only improve and modify the strength and neuromuscular control risk factors which is why these are key areas of screening process (Bonci 1999) The misalignment of the can increase the risk of injury particularly in the back and knee and this is very important in the lower limbs in athletes The locomotion part of any sport technique means that any problem with the lower limb will be subjected to extreme forces The knee in particular can only absorb certain amount of these forces and through the nature of sport the athlete will at some point suffer injury as result The degrees of misalignment that will cause sufficient risk to cause potential knee problems vary depending on several assessments (Bonci 1999)

In order to gain full assessment of these risks the athlete’s foot pronation knee recurvatum tibial torsion and posture need to be measured Neuromuscular control tests for the lower limb often involve variety of movements but with common goals: to obtain an objective assessment of function and to challenge dynamic knee stability during landing and deceleration (Bonci 1999) A range of tests can be used to achieve these goals with the single-leg hop one-leg vertical jump timed hop of eight running side stepping and stair running being few of the commonly used ones (Lephart et al 1991) These tests can also be combined with isokinetic testing to give rounded picture of the knee (Barber et al 1990; Lephart et al 1991)

The way the athlete’s foot lands during their gait has large impact on the distribution of the force created If the level of pronation is too high then one of the ’s natural shock absorbers the heel will be unable to prevent force from traveling up to the knee The contact phase is where the level of pronation in the foot is critical If the correct amount is present the movement will be inefficient and shock absorption will not occur adequately in the heel

# Q Angle

Figure 26 The Q angle (Bonci 1999) Reproduced with permission from Bonci CM (1999) Assessment and evaluation of predisposing factors to anterior cruciate ligament injury Journal of Athletic Training 34(2) 155–164 Copyright 1999 National Athletic Trainers’ Association Inc wwwnataorg/jat

Pronation is important to the support phase but not as stated in the contact to the shock absorption problems (Bonci 1999) The navicular drop test is commonly used to assess the pronation of the foot and identifies the difference between the subtalar joint (STJ) in seated neutral position (position A in Figure 25) and weight-bearing position (position B in Figure 25) Athletes who have had ACL problems generally have difference of 13mm when compared to healthy individuals who will have difference of just 8mm (Bonci 1999)

Genu recurvatum is also known as knee hyperextension and is normally due to problems in the athlete’s skeleton and/or movement pattern abnormalities and proprioception The problem is often increased due to soft tissue laxities which cause occasional hyperextension of the knee Over the course of the athlete’s career the extent and occurrences of the hyperextensions will begin to place extra strain on the ACL This measurement is normally assessed through the extent of laxity of the thumb fingers elbows and hyperextension of the knee (Bonci 1999)

An athlete with two or more postural problems that can be interlinked can have an increased risk of knee injuries The increase of the Q angle can be an indicator of problem occurring in the knee and of increased strain being placed on the ACL The Q angle is the angle between the force line of the quadriceps and the line of pull of the patella tendon (see Figure 26) (Merchant et al 2008) The Q angle in normal athlete is between 10 and 15 degrees (Bonci 1999) The Q angle is useful measure of potential knee problems but the validity of this is under discussion (Merchant et al 2008)

The variety of methods used to assess the Q angle has caused problems with the standardization of the results found Therefore the use of an athlete’s Q angle must be used in conjunction with other tests to complete the screening picture (Smith et al 2008)

The strength of the muscles around the knee has an important role to play in stabilizing the joint and

# Injury Prevention and Screening

Reducing the chances of injury is crucial for athletes For example if the hamstring is more than 15% weaker than the other lower limb muscles the athlete is 26 times more likely to suffer lower limb injury (Knapik et al 1991; Gabbe et al 2009) Muscle imbalances between limbs as well as within are important in assessing the potential for injury in the knee particularly in females where such imbalances are found in 20–30% of athletes (Bonci 1999; Gabbe et al 2004)

The ratio of flexion and extension of the joint is also measure of potential injury An athlete with ratio (eccentric to concentric) of less than 075 is 16 times more likely to suffer knee injuries (Moul 1998) Isokinetic testing at 60 180 and 300 degrees can help accurately establish these ratios and identify potential problems but this is very sensitive to velocity changes in the testing protocol (Moore and Wade 1989) Traditional functional assessments can also provide this information albeit at lower degree of accuracy but still establish the athlete’s readiness for competition

The neuromuscular control of the athlete can be measured through series of jumps and hops to assess the stability and awareness the athlete has of their knee movement This is normally assessed on recovery from an injury and the most reliable test results are found using two or more jump types (Bonci 1999)

Isokinetic testing can be used in various ways to profile an athlete to identify potential areas of injury concern The simplest method is to evaluate the power output of the movements associated with the sport played and compare these against the competitive requirements If there is deficit then the athlete is more likely to be at risk of injury when performing that movement and can be discouraged from doing it until their power output is improved (Rosenblum and Shankar 2006) When this is complete it has been found to offer about 10% reduction in injuries (Rosenblum and Shankar 2006) (see Chapter 3 assessing performance for greater detail regarding isokinetic assessment)

The flexibility of the muscles in the lower limbs plays an important role in the prevention of injuries to the area and should go hand in hand with muscle development program The role of equipment used in the athlete’s chosen sport can also have major effect on the potential injuries that they could suffer For example the height of the saddle in cycling can have implications for range of conditions in the knee of cyclists If the saddle is too high the athlete could suffer from iliotibial band (ITB) pain and potentially suffer from ACL strains (Callaghan 2005) Conversely if the saddle is too low the athlete could suffer from patellofemoral pain low back pain (LBP) and anterior knee pain (Callaghan 2005)

The technique of the athlete needs to be addressed to ensure that there are limited biomechanical faults which could also lead to injury The way in which cyclists position their feet on the pedal is important for two main reasons If the position is incorrect then the cyclist’s cadence and resultant power will be affected and performance will be hindered Secondly if the foot is incorrectly positioned it can cause knee and back problems depending on whether it is either too far forward or too far back

The ability to rotate the heel using the toe as fixed pivot is also important to reduce stress on the knee and increase the efficiency of movement (Callaghan and Jarvis 1996) Through kinematic analysis using pressure plates in the clips the optimum reduction of pain in the knee while minimizing the impact on the power phase of cycling can be found The clip system now recommended to cyclists takes these factors into account

Two factors are the ‘floating clip’ system due to the amount of rotation given (Callaghan 2005) The role of the practitioner in assessing the athlete for potential injury should not just involve functional anatomical tests but should look at the sport as whole (Callaghan 2005; Callaghan and Jarvis 1996)

The problems that an athlete could potentially have are not just confined to the major joints of the back and the knee; the musculoskeletal system also needs to be assessed for any potential abnormalities A simple Gait Arms Legs Spine (GALS) test can be used to help identify abnormalities (Beattie et al 2008) The testing procedure has been found to be 95% accurate at helping to identify musculoskeletal abnormalities

The Gait is simply classified as abnormal or normal and then the arms legs and spine are identified by appearance and movement The appearance of the limb will first be assessed for abnormality and then the movement of the limb will follow using the same process The subjects are also asked general questions about any pain or stiffness in their muscles or joints (Beattie et al 2008)

The GALS offers useful screening of the muscles with very little deviation between practitioners up to 95% agreement in this research feature (Beattie et al 2008) GALS does however offer different results depending on the condition with it providing 53% of positive results with acute conditions versus 95% in chronic conditions This highlights the potential problems with diagnosing and screening musculoskeletal problems The length of time that athletes have had the issue will affect the way they answer the questions and how it will appear to the practitioner The variability of the issues can mean that there is no ‘golden test’ for screening and holistic approach to screening is the best approach to increase the accuracy of the results and therefore increase injury prevention (Beattie et al 2008)

The assessment of an athlete’s gait can often lead to the identification of potential and current musculoskeletal problems This can be completed by the practitioner ‘eyeballing’ athletes as they walk or run in front of them or through the use of biomechanics The athlete's gait can be assessed through the use of force plates and video analysis The history of gait analysis can be traced as far back as Leonardo da Vinci (Paul 2005) The aims are relatively still the same although with many more varied applications and not merely in the interest of locomotion An athlete’s gait can be looked at extensively in terms of performance improvements especially in elite sport where even the small percentage improvement of efficiency could lead to success Gait can also be used in the prevention of injury through the identification of where the forces are traveling during locomotion and their possible impact (Paul 2005)

The use of force plate can greatly enhance the accuracy of the screening process by being able to easily identify imbalances between the left and right limbs The exact forces can be measured and their direction so picture of how much of an impact gait abnormality will have on the athlete can be drawn up

The forces can be expressed in terms of percentage mass or any unit of force the practitioner wishes to work in (Paul 2005) The biomechanical approach can be used in conjunction with functional assessments to add detail and identify the extent of an identified problem forming complete screen (Paul 2005)

The use of high-speed video analysis can add further depth to screening process and in particular the assessment of the knee for potential anterior cruciate knee ligament injuries The kinematic model used for linking the moments of force calculated through video analyses with the appropriate screening problem is shown in Figure 210 (McClean Walker Ford Myer Hewett & Van den Bogert 2005) It is important when using video analysis to have an established model of reference to relate the analysis to in order to accurately identify the errors (McClean et al 2005)

Figure 211 shows the correlation of results between 2D analysis and 3D analysis when looking at knee valgus during side step motion The correlations found were moderate to good with the best correlation displayed when the valgus angles were greater You could interpret this as lack of sensitivity in the 2D analysis methodology which is indicated in the results The peak rotation force was later when using 2D analysis as seen in Figure 211 (McClean et al 2005) The lack of movement in the trace supports the lower sensitivity of the 2D analysis However the correlation does exist so the use of field-based 2D analysis is valid tool in the screening process (McClean et al 2005) 3D analysis is the ‘gold standard’ measurement for lower limb angles

# Injury Prevention and Screening

# Injury Prevention and Screening

When an injury occurs the adapts by ensuring extra force is exerted by the surrounding tissues such as ligaments and supporting muscles After recovery the muscle may remain deactivated and untrained leading to an overall reduction in force output For instance if the iliopsoas is affected there may be reduction in power in the soleus impacting the athlete’s technique and performance Ideally other tissues should compensate for the injured muscle without long-term effects on technique (Komura and Nagano 2004)

The muscles that significantly impact an athlete's gait include:

- Gluteus Medialis (GMED)
- Gluteus Minimus (GMIN)
- Hamstrings (HAM)
- Adductor Longus
- Adductor Magnus
- Tensor Fasciae Latae
- Gluteus Maximus (GMAX)
- Iliopsoas (ILIPSO)
- Rectus Femoris (RF)
- Vastus (VAS)
- Gastrocnemius (GAS)
- Soleus (SOL)
- Tibialis Anterior (TIBANT)

If the RF is damaged the VAS compensates for knee movement preventing loss of motion Similarly if the GMAX is deactivated hip extension is managed by the GMED and HAM The VAS takes over knee extension when the HAM is deactivated (Komura and Nagano 2004) Knowledge of muscle function is crucial for assessing injuries accurately If the GMAX is assumed to be functioning based on hip flexion performance underlying issues may go undiagnosed leading to further complications (Komura and Nagano 2004)

Increased bone-on-bone contact forces occur during locomotion particularly when muscles are deactivated For example deactivation of the HAM and ILIPSO raises bone-on-bone forces not only at the hip but also at the ankle as the VAS compensates Deactivation of the GMAX increases knee forces more than hip forces as the GMED and HAM take over the required force (Komura and Nagano 2004)

The 's ability to maintain locomotion is beneficial but hidden damage can pose problems in sports A thorough screening process is essential to identify damaged muscles that may become deactivated ensuring the athlete's long-term health (Komura and Nagano 2004)

There is clear need for sports organizations and teams to adopt proactive injury prevention strategies and enhance education for coaches and athletes to improve performance An example of this is seen in cricket (Dennis et al 2008) Functional tests are integral to sports team's screening process due to their ease of setup and accessibility to trained personnel

# Functional Tests

The screening process typically includes series of functional tests completed by squad members One common test is the knee extension test which assesses hamstring muscle length The athlete lies supine with the hip flexed at 90 degrees on the tested knee They are then asked to flex the knee maximally and the angle is recorded The final value is calculated as 90 minus the recorded angle If the athlete can fully extend the hip is moved to 30-degree position and the recorded angle is subtracted from 120 degrees (Dennis et al 2008)

The Modified Thomas Test (MTT) assesses hip abduction range and hip extension This test is performed over the edge of plinth with the athlete lying supine (Figure 214) The practitioner assists with abduction and hip flexion movements using goniometer to record the achieved angle (Dennis et al 2008)

The athlete’s hip internal and external rotation can also be measured in the prone position With the testing leg fully straightened the practitioner can move the limb as far as possible and measure the angle from the tibia line to the relative vertical line (Dennis et al 2008)

# Combined Elevation Test

This test measures the distance from the base of the thumb to the floor once the arms are fully elevated and the subject is in prone position with each arm fully extended This is used to measure thoracic extension strength and range of movement while the rest of the remains in contact with the ground Athletes need to hold this position for the duration of the test while holding their breath (Dennis et al 2008)

This test measures the strength of the core muscles by assessing the length of time the athlete can hold neutral lumbopelvic position (see Figure 215) The test is stopped if the athlete experiences any back pain to reduce the chances of injury The athlete’s time is recorded with normative non-back pain sufferers aiming for 725 ± 326 seconds (Schellenberg et al 2007)

# Dorsiflexion Ability and Calf Raises

The athlete's calf heel raises and ankle dorsiflexion ability are important in cricket especially for bowlers The athlete lunges towards wall and the maximum distance they can keep their feet planted on the ground while still touching the wall with their knee is recorded for their dorsiflexion ability The athlete performs calf raises to full height until failure with the amount and duration completed used to calculate their cycle per second (Dennis et al 2008)

# Bridging Hold Test

This test assesses gluteal musculature endurance The athlete supports the lower back to prevent arching while their leg position is confirmed and the length of time they can hold this position is recorded A healthy athlete with no back pain should aim for time of 1704 ± 425 seconds (Schellenberg et al 2007) If the athlete experiences back or hamstring pain the test is aborted to reduce the chances of injury The leg must remain fully elevated and extended throughout the test and then repeated on the other side (Dennis et al 2008)

This battery of tests provides practitioners with extensive data on the functional elements associated with cricket but they are relevant to most sports movements The muscular isometric ability of certain parts is also measured to give insight into overall physical performance

# Injury Prevention and Screening

# Injury Prevention and Screening

Coach education is essential to improve performance (Twomey et al 2009)

The focus on power and the endurance of certain muscle groups is crucial for athletes Practitioners can assess areas of weakness and potentially plan preventative injury program to improve performance levels through reduction in injuries (Dennis et al 2008)

The implementation of injury prevention within sports varies depending on the sport and possibly linked to the financial ability of the team or individual to employ the correct practitioners In the Australian Football League studies have shown that coaches have limited education regarding squad practices for injury prevention The general trend in football is for coaches to focus on maintaining core temperature and flexibility While these elements are important procedures should be implemented in training sessions to reduce lower limb injuries (LLI)

Preventing LLIs can be achieved through lateral movement practices and footwork drills Coaches also lack knowledge about treating old injuries and avoiding re-injury The importance of cool down needs improvement as the traditional focus is primarily on warm-ups before practice with little planned post-practice Coaches agree that this knowledge gap needs to be addressed

# Validity and Reliability of Screening Methods

When screening athletes for injury prevention it is important for practitioners to remain objective and ensure that recorded results are valid and reliable If measurements are administered by team of practitioners inter-practitioner reliability must be high Good inter-practitioner reliability is achieved by performing each test using the same protocol and standardizing failure points

Figure 217 indicates the reliability of series of well-used musculoskeletal screening tests and the differences between two practitioners' results Practitioners performed series of tests shown in Figure 217 which were repeated using the same subjects (Gabbe et al 2004)

In the majority of tests only the MTT of the quads indicated significant difference between practitioners but this difference was within the error range for this test as it was within 95% of the standard error measurement (SEM) Other tests such as the sit and reach lumbar extension slump test active hip internal rotation range of movement (IR ROM) test and active knee extension (AKE) test indicated excellent inter-practitioner reliability (Gabbe et al 2004)

The sets of tests assessed are well used in the field of musculoskeletal screening so the reliability of the testing protocols needs to be good as does the education of practitioners in the use of the tests as indicated in this research (Gabbe et al 2004)

The ability of practitioners to produce the same measurement between clients and on the same client over series of visits is paramount Practitioners must provide reliable measures to ensure that progress can be monitored and problems are correctly diagnosed to increase injury prevention The second part of the research indicates that overall the application of the tests is excellent with only two retests being significantly different from the first test: the sit and reach test and the passive straight leg raise (PSLR) test; both were within the SEM for these tests indicating that practitioners' techniques in completing the protocols were effective

The problems arising from the two protocols occur due to the use of very similar movements to complete the test and although these are very small errors this is something that needs to be monitored The ability to maintain objectiveness is important and as the results show in Figure 218 this is the case when using these screening tests (Gabbe et al 2004)

The use of video analysis can enhance the reliability of the test results and can be used in the field as well as in clinic or laboratory situation Many of the tests that have been discussed are functional assessments but practitioners can also perform series of field-based movements that will enable strength screening to be completed The field tests can be recorded and software used post completion to complete the measurements and increase the accuracy of the test Figure 219 outlines series of field tests that give an indication of muscular strength and any possible imbalances that might exist within the athlete The results indicate excellent SEM values for the entire test batch displayed demonstrating the validity of the protocols (Miller and Callister 2009)

The video analysis of the same test can then be used to gain the functional assessments required for screening post collection This is shown in Figure 218 which displays the reliability of the test again showing excellent SEM figures The higher values indicated in the video analysis of these movements are indicative of stability in the joints (Miller and Callister 2009) The use of this type of test battery could be implemented on large squads where time is limited to complete the screening session The use of video analysis and the simplistic nature of the tests do not decrease accuracy as the values in Figures 218 and 219 indicate but also help to increase objectivity (Miller and Callister 2009) The use of video analysis would also allow the practitioner to use more dynamic tests in the screening process to ensure that the athletes place similar forces on the that they would experience in their sport The static measurements are important but they need to be supported with dynamic movements to ensure that the screening process is sports specific (McClean et al 2005)

The need to have objective measures and not let personal views interfere with the screening process is important and vital to the success of the injury prevention plans and the reputation of the practitioner The need to ensure that practitioners have common core objectives and common protocols is also apparent in the increasing multi-cultural and cosmopolitan nature of today’s sport When athletes move around the globe they need to be sure that

# Risk Assessment in Injury Prevention

Injury prevention and musculoskeletal screening is of assessment of risk on an athlete The process can be as detailed as the practitioner desires but the loss of accuracy will suffer with lower detailed screening process Rather than viewing this process as collection of singular tests it should be viewed as building picture of the athlete’s functional capabilities performance matrix Once this matrix is established the ‘weak links’ can be worked on to improve the overall matrix and therefore the resultant performances of the athlete

The sites used in the proposed matrix are upper neck (UP) lower neck (LN) upper back (UB) shoulder blade (SB) shoulder joint (SJ) low back/pelvis (LB/P) hip (H) and lower leg (LG) These have series of tests to score which have an upper and lower threshold and cover all the directions indicated in Figure 220 The results are plotted in 3D space which enables the athlete’s weak links to be identified easily with the ideal result being complete block on the high threshold side of the cube (Mottram and Comerford 2008)

A series of tests are completed by the athlete that will cover series of directions and sites The tests can be easily scored and then classified by threshold limit and then marked on the matrix The weak links that need to be identified are usually areas of instability in the tested movements which occur when the athlete is not fatigued

The functional test indicates familiar starting position for functional test but with an additional twist to add further analysis The movement is then scored in detail using the scheme indicated in Figures 222 and 223 This one movement affects scoring for five sites and seven directions giving an indication of the ease at which complex picture can be built up of the athlete (Mottram and Comerford 2008)

The athlete’s weak links can be improved through targeted training which is possible as the site and direction of movement is clear The use of core stability training is often used to help improve the weak links Where motor control needs to be improved low threshold training is found to rectify both global and local problems effectively Once the motor control abnormalities have been rectified at lower threshold level they can then be built on at higher level to ensure the weak link is improved Training an athlete to ensure that they are prepared for injury needs detailed profile of the athlete’s strengths and weaknesses (Mottram and Comerford 2008)

If the weak links are not isolated correctly then they could be improved on with stronger areas thus not actually improving the area as both the strong and weak are training at the same rate The use of the type of testing schedule is not in the individual tests but with the links that can be drawn between them The use of trunk bridging has been shown to indicate lower back problems (Schellenberg et al 2007) which although may not produce definite indicator

# Conclusions

# Test 7B

# Start Position

Elbows push up + twist to side support

- Lie face down propped on elbows with hands pointing to opposite elbow
- Knees and feet together
- Shoulders midway between hitched and dropped
- Taking weight through the arms lift hips and knees off the floor pushing off the toes
- Make straight line with legs and trunk and head
- Keeping the pelvis neutral in straight line with the legs and trunk shift the upper weight onto one elbow
- As the weight shifts turn the whole 90° from the shoulder so that the whole is side on with the pelvis and knees unsupported and in straight line with the legs and trunk
- The forearm and feet are the only contact points
- The weight-bearing upper arm should be vertical

# Performance Matrix Analysis

- Can you prevent the back from side bending as the turn is initiated?
- Can you prevent the pelvis from leading the twist? (keep the back and pelvis turning together)
- Can you prevent the back from arching?
- Can you prevent the pelvis and bottom hip from dropping towards the floor in the side position?
- Can you prevent the hips from flexing? (keep the legs and trunk in straight line)
- Can you prevent the weight-bearing (WB) shoulder blade winging?
- Can you prevent the weight-bearing (WB) shoulder blade hitching?
- Can you prevent the weight-bearing (WB) shoulder blade dropping?
- Can you prevent forward protrusion of the head of the weight-bearing (WB) shoulder joint?
- Can you prevent the weight-bearing (WB) forearm from turning towards the feet (medial rotation) as the twists?
- Can you prevent the head from turning or tilting?

# Conclusion

With the correct identification of weak links injury prevention programmes can become more specialised and therefore meet the needs of an individual athlete to eradicate potential problems occurring due to the overcompensating due to weakness (Mottram and Comerford 2008) If the athlete is not prescribed appropriate conditioning to reduce the risk then problems will still occur The conditioning should be functional and appropriate to the athlete’s sport The conditioning must match the sporting movements associated muscle actions directional changes velocities and loads The need for pre-screening through the use of questionnaire like the NIMQ-E (Dawson et al 2009) will often eliminate athletes or areas from risk

# Injury Prevention and Screening

Testing should be efficient to avoid wasting valuable time on unnecessary tests An athlete's ability to cope with pain can provide insights into how they might handle an injury and whether they could potentially mask it (Westman et al 2008) The range of functional tests is extensive but practitioners must remain objective to ensure valid and reliable results thus maintaining the integrity of the process (Gabbe et al 2004) Utilizing biomechanics to enhance the analysis is crucial as history of injury can often be complex and traditional screening methods alone may not resolve the issue (Whiting and Zernicke 1998) Ultimately injury prevention involves assessing the risk of when an athlete may break down (Mottram and Comerford 2008) A novel approach to screening using performance matrix can help identify weak links and improve these potential breakdowns allowing for uninterrupted sporting performance (Mottram and Comerford 2008)

# Recommendations

For comprehensive musculoskeletal screening process the following stages are recommended:

1 The screening process should begin with detailed examination of the athlete's perception of pain using examples shown in Figures 21 and 28
2 This can be supported by the use of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to understand the athlete's pain tolerance and history
3 The physical examination should include functional assessments indicated in Figures 12–16 (Dennis et al 2008)
4 The athlete should undergo more dynamic assessment as detailed in research by Mottram and Comerford (2008) possibly incorporating video analysis for more detailed and objective evaluation (McClean et al 2005)
5 Upon completion of these stages matrix of the athlete's strengths and weaknesses can be developed to ensure program is created with strength and conditioning coach to address problem areas
6 The coach and athlete should be informed about recovery techniques to mitigate issues arising from training intensity such as proper cool-down and rehydration strategies
7 For further insights into the athlete's problem areas consulting biomechanist can enhance the analysis and identify technique errors as potential injury causes (Callaghan and Jarvis 1996; Paul 2005)

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Paul Comfort and Martyn Matthews

# University of Salford Greater Manchester

To condition athletes effectively training must reflect the conditions encountered in sport To achieve this programme designers must:

1 Analyse the demands of the sport;
2 Identify the individual characteristics of the athlete (strengths and weaknesses; training history);
3 Tailor and prioritise training to allow each individual athlete to meet these specific demands

To effectively test an athlete’s fitness and therefore develop an appropriate training and rehabilitation regime sports rehabilitators and strength and conditioning coaches must identify the essential components of the sport/activity in question This ‘needs analysis’ requires the gathering of accurate precise and reliable data ideally from the published literature combined with detailed observation of training and competition Appropriate fitness tests can then be selected and conducted with comparisons made to determine individual strengths and weaknesses that inform the implementation of appropriate training that focuses on the sport the athlete and any identified injury risk It is essential that the sports rehabilitator develop an applied awareness of such methods of assessing an athlete in order to complement their clinical assessments/skills when determining an athlete’s readiness to return to sport A more detailed understanding of the demands of the sports will also be invaluable in terms of implementing effective and evidence-based injury prevention programmes

The primary aim of this chapter is therefore to explore how to conduct an appropriate needs analysis The chapter begins with an exploration of the different components required in order to undertake an effective needs analysis including the metabolic and mechanical demands of the sport/activity This leads the reader on to on fitness testing which discusses the variety of testing modalities available and includes some discussion of the validity and reliability of these methods The chapter then provides two detailed summaries of needs analyses as examples (football and rugby league) of the process as whole

# Analysing the Demands of Sport

To analyse the specific demands of the sport sports rehabilitators must consider the demands placed on the muscular nervous endocrine cardiovascular respiratory and skeletal systems They must consider:

- The length of the event;
- The type speed and frequency of movement involved;
- The pattern of play and work–rest ratios;
- The nature of contact with other players or opponents;
- The competition structure

They must consider the combined demands of both training and performance and the injury risk that arises in each They must consider the nutritional and psychological demands of the sport and the effect that these may have on performance recovery and rehabilitation

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Metabolic Demands

The metabolic demands of sport are determined by the biochemical pathways used for energy production in that sport These energy pathways produce adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) the only source of energy for muscular contraction There are three systems responsible for energy production:

- Phosphagen system
- Glycolytic system
- Aerobic system

# Phosphagen System

The phosphagen system is very powerful system producing large quantities of ATP from phosphocreatine (PCr) Unfortunately the combined stores of ATP and PCr only provide enough energy for 6–8 seconds of intense muscular contraction This system predominates in sports requiring short duration maximal intensity bouts of effort such as weight lifting high jump and short sprints (60 100 and 200m) It plays crucial role in team sports requiring multiple short bursts of activity

# Glycolytic System

The glycolytic system is another powerful system for producing ATP for high-intensity activity It is less powerful than the phosphagen system but can produce ATP for longer It takes about 5 seconds to reach maximal production capacity and lasts for 30–40 seconds at maximal intensity This system predominates in longer duration high intensity activities (eg 400m) and during the sprint finish of longer events Together the phosphagen and glycolytic systems are anaerobic or oxygen independent

# Aerobic System

The aerobic system is oxygen dependent and can produce vast quantities of ATP very efficiently but at much slower rate It starts producing ATP as soon as exercise begins but does not reach full capacity for several minutes This system predominates in events requiring high levels of endurance such as rowing cycling and distance running as well as team events where high intensity bursts of activity must be repeated throughout the course of long game (up to 90 minutes) During these events the aerobic system plays crucial role in replenishing phosphocreatine and dominates during recovery between bursts of activity

It is essential to remember that most sports require combination of all three systems For example football utilizes the phosphagen system most during repeated high intensity bouts of activity the glycolytic system during extended periods of high intensity play and the aerobic system during recovery phases (including half-time) Training should reflect the specific nature of energy system usage by targeting the dominant pathways while recognizing the contributing role of the other systems

# Mechanical Demands

# Movement Specificity

The mechanical demands of sport determine the movements that athletes should train Exercises that are similar to the actual movements encountered in sport should be prioritized For example there is triple extension of the ankles knees and hips during vertical jump; therefore exercises that involve rapid extension of these joints such as squat jumps the clean or snatch should be targeted By focusing on movement pattern specificity athletes can reinforce and condition the motor programmes used in skilled performance

# Analyzing the Demands of Sport

# Training Methods

Precise order timing and force application are essential for enabling the muscles to produce predetermined movement (Enoka 2002) The more practiced and efficient these programs are the better the performance of the skill For example rugby player who focuses practice on the foot patterns required to side-step an opponent can enhance side-stepping performance by executing quicker more efficient motor programs during the game However these are generally trained and refined during skill training

The training methods that transfer best to actual sporting performance usually involve coordinated movements across multiple joints rather than strict isolation exercises In sport no muscle works in isolation Isolating specific muscles is non-functional; gains in strength power or endurance occur only in the trained muscle and fail to integrate with the whole movements required for sporting performance Athletes must consider how to train movements not muscles Training that focuses on the whole movement enhances sports performance more effectively than the training of isolated joint movements (Bompa 1999; McGill 2006) Moreover closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises have greater effect on functional performance when compared to open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises (Augustsson et al 1998; Blackburn and Morrissey 1998) Integrate don’t isolate

# Muscle Action

As well as training to produce force it is also essential to develop an athlete’s ability to accept force Sport requires athletes to reduce and absorb external forces often at high speeds in three dimensions and in an unpredictable environment Athletes must train for deceleration and force-acceptance as well as force production Training tends to focus on concentric force development; however many sports require heavy load eccentric muscle actions which can also be high velocity especially during rapid decelerations and changes of direction Eccentric training jump landings dynamic control and stabilization training along with specific jumping and agility drills will increase an athlete’s capacity to control and manage the specific forces encountered during sport

For example athletes typically train hamstrings by using knee flexion exercises (leg curls) and hip extension exercises (stiff-legged deadlifts) In function however the hamstrings also act to control and decelerate the limb (as in kicking football) act antagonistically to the rectus femoris to prevent hip flexion (as in squatting or jumping) and act as an ACL agonist by preventing anterior tibial translation (Li et al 1999; Ebben and Leigh 2000) Movements that target these attributes may include Nordic hamstring lowers (Askling et al 2003; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Clark et al 2005; Arnason et al 2007) drop jump landings (including correct landing during plyometric activity) and lunges (Jonhagen et al 2009) increasing progressively in terms of both velocity and amplitude Eccentric and plyometric training has also been shown to decrease the risk/incidence of both ACL and hamstring strain injuries (Hewett et al 1996; Heidt et al 2000; Clark et al 2005; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Wilkerson et al 2004; Hewett et al 2005; Mandelbaum et al 2005; Myer et al 2005)

# Direction and Velocity of Force

Sporting movements often require athletes to produce and accept forces in multiple planes at various speeds all in fluid and ever-changing environment Sports rehabilitators athletes and coaches therefore need to identify what these movement patterns are and where safe to do so tailor training and rehabilitation to mimic these For example functional movement patterns are enhanced by training at greater speeds in multiple directions and under varied and unpredictable conditions This challenges an athlete’s balance and proprioception enhancing their ability to stabilize joints and maintain posture allowing the transfer of forces efficiently from one to another

Exercises that incorporate fast eccentric loading in the initial phases and place high demand on an athlete’s ability to dynamically stabilize their joints under varying conditions also allow them to develop greater control and accept higher forces quickly For example plyometric training should begin with primarily vertical movements followed by forward momentum then lateral movements finally progressing to multidirectional movements which progressively become more sport-specific (Dugan 2005)

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

Sporting movements occur quickly often between 30 and 260 ms For example at the beginning of the race when sprinter drives out of the blocks and accelerates up to full speed the ground contact time can be greater than 200 ms (Mero 1988; McKenna and Riches 2007) whereas when the athlete reaches peak running velocity the contact time is nearer to 70–125 ms (Kunz and Kaufmann 1981; Mann and Herman 1985; Moravec et al 1987; Chu and Korchemny 1993; Weyland et al 2000; McKenna & Riches 2007)

# Fitness Testing

# The Importance of Fitness Testing

To determine the current status of an athlete’s fitness and monitor the progress made during both training and rehabilitation specific components of fitness must be assessed Fitness testing allows coaches and rehabilitators to identify an athlete’s strengths and weaknesses enabling them to tailor and adjust training and rehabilitation according to the athlete’s greatest need(s) This optimises the use of training time and resources helping to achieve maximal performance gains and enhance rehabilitation as efficiently as possible Regular fitness testing provides vital information to athletes and their support teams and should therefore part of any athlete’s development programme Moreover fitness testing is also used to monitor the effectiveness of training programmes establish baseline that may be used to monitor the progress of rehabilitation post-injury provide motivational tool for athletes (particularly those that train independently) and enable coaches to identify future talent Without fitness testing it is impossible to accurately and objectively monitor an athlete’s progress or assess readiness to return to sport post-injury

# Validity Reliability and Objectivity

For tests to be effective and reflect the changes in an athlete’s fitness they must be valid and reliable repeated at regular intervals using carefully controlled procedures and be understood by athletes and coaches To ensure this the principles of validity reliability and objectivity must be taken into account

# Validity

Validity refers to what is actually measured Some tests directly measure that which is required; what you see is what you get For example in 40 m sprint test time is recorded and if electronic timing equipment is used the time recorded is an accurate reflection of the time taken to complete the test; in maximum strength test the highest weight lifted is recorded (1 repetition maximum – 1RM); and in skin-fold calliper test skin-fold thickness is recorded In the latter case the measurement of skin-fold thickness is only measure of skin-fold thickness not fat The calculation of fat is an estimation based on prediction equations (Jackson et al 1980; Pollock and Jackson 1984)

# Reliability

The next consideration is reliability (see Table 31 for specific reliability data) This is the extent to which scores are consistent and repeatable across time or between testers and therefore reflects the ability to detect actual changes with time Even direct measurements may be subject to errors For example if 40 m sprint is timed by hand the timekeeper must determine when the athlete started and finished There may be delay as the brain processes this information and also delay before the is pressed and the clock stopped Hand timing then relies on an individual interpreting what they see and deciding when to press the This inbuilt inaccuracy may be greater than any differences in actual time between testing sessions and so may not be sensitive enough to reflect legitimate training improvements Other challenges to the reliability of tests include variations with equipment test environment the weather warm-up procedures or subject motivation between testing sessions In terms of assessing composition via skin fold measurements errors in testing can include improper site selection and measurement use of different callipers and intra- and inter-tester variation (Pollock and Jackson 1984)

# Objectivity

Objectivity refers to any bias that originates with either the tester or the athlete Tester bias may include subtle differences in testing protocols (such as the positioning and timing of skin-fold measurements) or interpretation of test performance (stopping the clock when the tester perceives that the athlete crossed the line) Subject bias may include situations where the athlete being tested aims to manipulate the results

SEM = standard error of measurement

Note: Many teams expect an athlete’s fitness to improve throughout the course of pre-season training and sometimes impose fines on those athletes that do not improve There is therefore temptation for some athletes to intentionally under-perform in the first battery of tests so that they are more likely to record an improvement as pre-season training progresses thereby avoiding fine

|Laboratory Tests|Advantages|Disadvantages|Field Tests|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Lots of information|Expensive| |Widely available|Changes in testing environment|
| |Reproducible|Non-functional| |Functional|Equipment must be accurate|
| |Precise and direct measurements|Can take lot of time| |Time efficient for teams|Some errors in prediction|

# Laboratory versus Field Testing

Despite the lack of direct transfer to competition laboratory tests do have several advantages A laboratory allows the same test to be reproduced under similar conditions on separate occasions This increases the sensitivity of the test and allows subtle changes in fitness to be monitored over time without interference from varying environmental conditions (Table 32)

Field-testing in contrast has number of advantages over laboratory-based tests Tests can be devised that more closely mimic the requirements of the particular sports For example the changes of direction that occur in the Multi Stage Fitness Test (Bleep Test) and particularly the yo-yo test closely resemble some of the movement characteristics and work–rest ratios of team sports It could be argued that performance in the yo-yo test gives better indication of soccer player’s ability to perform in an intermittent multi-directional activity like soccer than their performance in laboratory-based treadmill test

Castagna et al (2006) found that VO2 max data collected via the yo-yo test was strongly and significantly related to VO2 max (r = 075 < 0001) via treadmill direct gas analysis in adult male soccer players Metaxas et al (2005) found 105–133% variation in VO2 max measurements assessed via the yo-yo endurance test the yo-yo intermittent test and continuous and intermittent treadmill tests However the authors concluded that yo-yo field tests should be used to monitor aerobic fitness in team sports as they are easy to administer and incorporate into training sessions during the competitive season

In review of literature Bangsbo et al (2008) concluded that the yo-yo intermittent recovery test is simple and valid method of assessing an individual’s capacity to perform repeated intense exercise bouts and monitoring changes in performance capacity

Additional considerations when selecting testing methods are time and reproducibility In terms of the use of the yo-yo test for team sports it is far more time efficient than individually assessing the whole team and it is also highly reproducible if the testing conditions (clothing equipment time of day warm-up) remain constant If working with marathon runner however the most valid and reliable method of assessing aerobic capacity would be via direct gas analysis

Field tests also have the advantage that they are simpler easier to set up and administer and can often be applied to several athletes at once As each athlete has minimal disruption to their routine field tests may therefore be the most practical choice for regular monitoring of training gains

Where available it is sometimes possible to take traditional laboratory equipment into the field Mobile gas analysis devices such as the MetamaxTM allow sophisticated tests to be conducted in an ecologically valid setting

# Test Order

When conducting several tests the order in which the individual tests are performed is vital The performance of previous test can impact the performance of subsequent one For example test to assess anaerobic endurance requires high intensity of effort for an extended duration causing considerable fatigue and leaving the athlete below normal capacity for some time Any subsequent tests performed whilst the athlete is still fatigued will be severely impaired If that test is agility and on re-test the athlete scores higher than before then athletes and coaches cannot conclude that agility has actually improved Several factors could have contributed to better agility result These include: an improved anaerobic endurance leading to less induced fatigue; improved

# Figure 31: The Metamax Testing System

Figure illustrating the Metamax testing system

Cardiovascular fitness leads to quicker recovery and lower motivation levels during the anaerobic test which can result in less fatigue These factors may allow the athlete to start the agility test in better state of readiness potentially recording improvements that are not solely due to enhancements in agility

To ensure that any changes recorded genuinely reflect improvements the impact of previous tests must be minimized The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) (Baechle & Earle 2008) suggests the following test order:

**Table 33: Test Order**
|Order|Test|
|---|---|
|1|Agility|
|2|Speed|
|3|Muscular Strength|
|4|Muscular Endurance|
|5|Aerobic Capacity (ideally on separate day)|

Agility and speed are tested first as they are short relatively non-fatiguing activities that require only few minutes for full recovery Testing these early will not impact later results Strength should be tested next as the actual tests require little recovery (5 minutes) and have minimal impact on subsequent muscular or cardiovascular endurance Muscular/Anaerobic endurance should be tested after strength as these tests can induce fatigue in the muscles and significantly affect subsequent strength skill and speed performance

Depending on the requirements of the sport cardiovascular fitness (usually assessed via maximal test that also stresses the anaerobic energy systems) may also need to be addressed In this case it should either replace the anaerobic endurance test or be tested on separate occasion

# Designing Battery of Fitness Tests

When designing battery of fitness tests several factors must be considered including:

- Selection of tests (which ones and how many)
- Order of tests
- Recovery period between tests
- Equipment needed
- Adjustments for different playing positions

The choice of tests should reflect the characteristics of both the sport and the individual player position For example:

- A cycle-based test will have almost no transfer to sports that require athletes to run
- A strength assessment using bench press will not necessarily transfer to throwing or punching activities
- A constant-pace running-based endurance test for goalkeeper will be less functional than test of repetitive explosiveness or agility

The order of tests should be chosen to minimize interference between tests (Baechle and Earle 2008)

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Factors to Consider When Designing Battery of Tests

|Factor|Consideration|
|---|---|
|How many tests?|Maximum of seven|
|What tests?|Decision based on functional characteristics of the sport Will an improvement in the test result in an improved performance in the sport?|
|What order?|Agility speed strength/muscular endurance anaerobic/aerobic endurance|
|How long in between?|Enough for full recovery from previous test|
|What equipment?|Timing gates; tape measure; cones; sports hall etc|
|Changes to account for different positions|Different tests required to gain useful information about different positions For example: goalkeeper versus midfield player|

The length of rest between tests should be long enough to allow complete recovery so that interference is minimized The equipment should allow tests to be accurately reproduced and limit tester objectivity (timing gates versus hand timing)

Depending on where tests originated distances may be expressed in metres or yards In reality 40m test is no better or worse than 40 yard test The important issues to consider are consistency across time (when repeating tests) and an awareness of any differences when comparing test results to normative data

# Assessing Agility

Shuttle runs are widely used as test of agility providing information on explosiveness acceleration deceleration turning ability functional lower strength and control No agility test should last longer than about 10 seconds Beyond this performance is determined far more by an athlete’s speed-endurance capabilities than agility

With all agility runs careful placing of extra timing gates (before and after the turn) can help establish whether improvements in overall performance are the result of improved speed or improved turning ability

# Illinois Agility Test

The Illinois agility test is designed to test acceleration deceleration cutting and turning ability Performance is determined by the time that is taken to complete the course The use of timing gates is essential

# Speed

The best way to test an athlete’s speed is to assess their performance over sport-specific distances For example short sprints lasting 10–40 m are used to mimic the sprint distances typically observed during competition

# T-test

The T-test is 40m (or 40 yard) agility test that incorporates forward sprinting side-to-side shuffling and backwards running It is particularly suited to both team and racquet sports

Intraclass reliability for the T-test has also been shown to be as high as 098 (Pauole et al 2000) therefore small changes in performance should be direct result of adaptations to training

 be altered for different sports to make the test sport

Figure 3period3 Illinois agility test

team sports; 6s or 10s sprints on cycle ergometer
are used to test speed in track cyclists; 10 20 30
or 40 m sprints in multiple sprint sports; and 100m
sprints on rowing ergometer are used to test speed
in rowers
 These short sprints are the best way of assessing
functional speed as they actually do measure short
sprint ability Because they all start from standing
they also give an indication of explosiveness and
acceleration ability As with all such tests (including
agility tests) timing must be performed with timing
gates or similar electronic method (Hand timing is
not an acceptable method of timing due to the level
of accuracy/reliability)

Sprint tests

Tests consist of three sprints from standing start
with full recovery between runs The best time is
always taken Some researchers take the average of
three; however it is usually not appropriate to use this
method as single poor result can skew the recorded
ﬁgure
 Starting position and height of the timing gates
also needs to be standardised Small differences in
times as result of starting position are not inter-
changeable (Duthie et al 2006) with starting posi-
tions with feet parallel resulting in slower times than
those where the dominant foot is placed forwards
Vertical jump tests
Vertical jump tests are widely used to assess single-
and double-legged vertical jumping ability They fo-
cus on particular performance parameter (height
jumped) and in this respect are highly functional to
those sports requiring vertical jumping ability such
as basketball and volleyball Variations of the test
can include two-legged take off one-legged take
off step and one-legged take off (tennis soccer)
or measuring the height jumped after drop off of 
small platformTwo common methods are employed to determine
height jumped The ﬁrst uses contact mats to deter-
mine ﬂight time The second is simple jump and
reach method Both methods appear to be valid and
reliable tests (r equal 0967 and 0906 respectively) when
compared to three-camera motion analysis system
(Leard et al 2007) Another method is to attach 
linear position transducer to belt/harness that the
athlete wears On jumping the device records the lin-
ear displacement during each jump and can provide
reliable data regarding jump height peak force (intr-
aclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) equal 0977–0982)
mean force (ICC equal 0924–0975) and time to peak
force (0721–0964) (Cronin et al 2004)
 Although vertical jump tests do not measure
power (they measure height jumped unless per-
formed on force plate) the ability to jump high
is closely correlated with this parameter This rela-
tionship has permitted the development of prediction
equations for peak power output during the verti-
cal jump which removes the need for force plates
to monitor athletes’ peak power during the vertical
jump Keir et al(2003) found that peak power (W)
can be predicted (within 2%) via height jumped (cm)
and mass (kg) with very high level of reli-
ability (rgreater09999 CV less02%) (see Table 31 and

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

Vertical jump assessments can also be performed with additional load (also referred to as squat jumps) depending on the requirements of the sport However these do require the use of force plate to determine peak power output peak force and rate of force development In trained individuals high test–retest correlations (ICC range: 075–099) are observed during unloaded and loaded jump squats (30 and 60% 1RM) with familiarisation not necessary due to low individual variation (CV range: 1–2–76%) (Moir et al 2005)

Maulder and Cronin (2005) adapted the vertical jump from bilateral to unilateral test and found that test–retest reliability remained high (ICC equal 086 dominant leg 082 non-dominant leg) Performance of unilateral assessments can highlight limb asymmetries and therefore act as potential marker of injury risk

# Horizontal Jump Tests

Horizontal jump tests are useful to assess power in horizontal direction Tests such as the standing long jump and the standing triple jump where the athlete attempts to jump for distance from standing start provide useful information about an athlete’s horizontal hopping ability and their ability to control their landing Both of these tests are highly reliable with ICC of 095 and 093 and coefficient of variation of 24% and 29% respectively (Markovic et al 2004)

Maulder and Cronin (2005) adapted the standing long jump from bilateral to unilateral test and found that test–retest reliability remained high (ICC equal 090 dominant leg 089 non-dominant leg) The study also found that performance in the horizontal jumps was better predictor of 20m sprint ability than vertical jumps (r equal 073 and 066 respectively)

# Hop Tests

There are number of hop tests available (hop for distance triple hop for distance cross-over hop for distance and 6m hop for time) which were primarily developed to assess power-based performances during horizontal movements These tests are now commonly used in clinical environments to assess/monitor rehabilitation from lower limb injury Along with the performance measures obtained during these tests kinematic evaluation of the performances may also highlight additional risk factors for knee injury if poor lower limb control and landing mechanisms are identified (Fitzgerald et al 2001)

# The Tests

# Single Hop for Distance

The athlete starts with their toe on start line hands on hips and their non-involved leg held in front at 90 degrees of hip flexion to prevent any countermovement The subject then hops as far as possible with the tester measuring from the initial toe position (start line) to the heel strike Participants must be stable on landing

Research has demonstrated high level of reliability (ICC r = 092–096) with standard error of measurement of 461–456 cm (Bolgla and Keskula 1997; Ross et al 2002)

# Triple Hop for Distance

Performed in the same way as the single hop for distance only three consecutive hops are performed with the total distance measured from the start line to the final heel strike Again participants must be stable on landing

Research has demonstrated high level of reliability (ICC r = 095–097) with standard error of measurement of 1117–1555 cm (Bolgla and Keskula 1997; Ross et al 2002)

# Cross-Over Hop for Distance

The athlete starts in the same position as for the other hops only this time it is essential that tape (≥ 8 m) measure is stuck to the ground leading away from the start line If the athlete begins on their right leg they need to start to the right of the tape Each hop is performed as in the triple hop for distance with the only difference being that the athlete must cross the measuring tape during each hop

Research has demonstrated high level of reliability (ICC r = 093–096) with standard error of measurement of 1595–1774 cm (Bolgla and Keskula 1997; Ross et al 2002)

It would be much more accurate and reliable if timing gates are positioned at 6 m intervals Research has demonstrated varying level of reliability (ICC r = 066–092) and standard error of measurement of 006–013 s (Bolgla and Keskula 1997; Ross et al 2002) The more varied range of reliability and standard error of measurement may be due to the fact that stopwatches were used for timing

# Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)

The star excursion balance test (SEBT) is commonly performed to assess dynamic balance and stability across multiple planes of movement Poor performance in one limb compared to the other is good indicator of bilateral instability and possible imbalance especially when combined with the results of assessments such as the hop tests

The SEBT is performed with the athlete standing on the middle of the grid (see Figure 35) on the leg to be tested The grid consists of lines extending out from the centre at 45 degrees (see Figure 36) Foot position should be standardised with the heel in the centre of the grid and the big toe on the anteriorly projected line With the other leg the individual reaches as far as possible along each line in turn returning the leg to the start position between each attempt (the reaching leg must not be used for support) The distance reached in each direction is recorded

To standardise the test and provide familiarisation the participants should be provided 4–6 practice attempts followed by 

# Six-Meter Hop for Time

The athlete begins on the start line and hops as quickly as possible on the appropriate leg to the finish line (6 m away) This has been conducted using stopwatch but due to the range of human error (as discussed elsewhere in this chapter)

# Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)

The SEBT requires 5-minute rest prior to the actual testing to eliminate any fatigue Kinzey and Armstrong (1998) demonstrated that practice attempts raised the reliability of testing from r = 067–087 depending on the direction to r > 086

This test has been shown to be good indicator of progress in dynamic postural and lower limb control during rehabilitation from knee (Herrington et al 2009) and ankle injury and chronic ankle instability (Gribble et al 2004; Munn et al 2009) via comparison of the performances of the injured to the non-injured leg Plisky et al (2006) also found the SEBT to be good predictor of lower extremity injury and recommended its inclusion into pre-participation screening

It is essential that the SEBT and similar dynamic balance/stability tests are performed prior to any possible fatiguing activity as Gribble et al (2004) found that fatigue resulted in noticeable decrease in performance in the SEBT

# Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT)

The Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) is 30-second cycle test providing information on peak power mean power muscle endurance and muscle fatigability It is relatively simple and inexpensive test that is reliable and repeatable (especially in motivated subjects) is sensitive to change over time and truly reflects person’s anaerobic performance capacity

Although the test is well established and widely used in an educational setting its application to most sports is limited It is highly specific for sprint cyclists but not functional for other sports; however number of studies summarised by Inbar et al (1996) have found strong associations with some field tests for assessing power including 40m sprint speed (r = 084) and vertical jump (r = 070) but weak associations with others (Sargeant anaerobic skating test r = 032)

There are also number of modified versions of the WAnT with varying loads and varying durations When monitoring peak power output these are all highly reliable but it is essential to use the same loads if comparisons of peak power are going to be made at later date Using modified protocols to predict fatigue index and minimum power also appear to be highly reliable (R² = 084 and 091 respectively) (Stickley et al 2008)

When testing athletes consistency between tests is essential For the WAnT the equipment used (pedal crank length toe clips seat height cycle geometry resistance setting) can be adjusted to exact settings and therefore made both highly specific to the individual cyclist’s actual bike and also reproducible across time Care must also be taken to ensure consistency of environment (controlled laboratory conditions) as well as motivation of the athlete

Familiarisation with the test is also essential as Barfield et al (2002) demonstrated that subjects exhibit an increase in peak power output (14%) and mean power output (5%) due to practice/familiarisation effect

# The Tests

It is therefore recommended that individuals perform familiarisation test several days prior to any baseline measurements It is important to consider the validity of using such laboratory tests to predict on-the-field performance especially when the mode of laboratory testing (eg cycling) is mechanically different from the requirements of the sport (eg sprinting and jumping) This was highlighted by Baker and Davis (2002) who found that peak power output during modified WAnT was unrelated to sprinting (10 30 and 40m) and jumping (vertical and horizontal) performance; however jumping and sprinting test performance were highly related (r = 080–091; < 001)

# Assessing Strength and Muscular Endurance

Strength is defined as the ability of muscle group to develop maximal contractile force against resistance in single contraction Muscular endurance is the ability of muscle group to exert sub-maximal force over repeated contractions or for extended periods

When assessing strength and muscular endurance we must therefore take account of the specific strength requirements of the sport These include range of movement joint angle position type of muscle action (concentric eccentric isometric) and also velocity of movement and the speeds at which strength must be applied It should therefore be possible to both train and assess strength in functional manner

# Major Areas of Strength Assessment

There are three major areas of strength assessment: isotonic isokinetic and isometric

# Isotonic Measurement

Isotonic tests use free weights and are used to determine both maximal strength (via the one repetition maximum (1RM) test) which gives an indication of the maximum weight that can be lifted by muscle group and local muscular endurance where an athlete’s ability to perform multiple repetitions of sub-maximal load is assessed

# One Repetition Maximum Test

To record an accurate test score for 1RM the following procedure should be followed (adapted from Kraemer and Fry 1995):

1 Warm up with 5–10 repetitions of the test exercise at load of 40–60% of estimated 1RM Rest for 1–2 minutes

# 1RM Testing Procedure

1 Perform 3–5 repetitions at 60–80% of estimated 1RM Rest for 4–5 minutes
2 Increase the weight by between 5 and 10% and attempt 1RM lift
3 If successful rest for further 4–5 minutes increase weight by approximately 5% and repeat
4 Repeat until 1RM is achieved

Note: A novice may require 6–7 attempts to reach their 1RM A more experienced lifter with more accurate perception of their true strength may need 3–5 attempts

Because 1RM testing requires maximal effort it is usually confined to the more familiar free-weight squat deadlift and bench press exercises Wisloff et al (2004) found that 1RM squat had strong correlation with:

- 10m sprint time (r = 094 < 0001)
- 30m sprint time (r = 071 < 001)
- Vertical jump height (r = 078 < 002)

Moreover Baker (2001) found strong correlation (r = 087) between maximal strength during the bench press and peak power output during bench throws using variety of loads However 1RM testing may not always be functional and any interpretation of results or predictions of future performance based on these results should take this into account

Furthermore testers should be aware that athletes unfamiliar with the test will underperform when compared with more experienced lifters As such tests should always incorporate familiarization period prior to testing to account for any learning effect

# Three or Five Repetition Maximum Test

Many athletes particularly if they do not lift free weights regularly as part of their conditioning programme are not always comfortable with the maximal effort required for 1RM testing As such it may be appropriate to conduct 3RM or 5RM test instead Strength is still being assessed (there is high correlation between 3RM and 5RM scores and 1RM scores) but the athletes may be happier with sub-maximal (but still very heavy) load

It is important with all strength and local muscular endurance assessment to ensure that technique remains constant throughout the test and between testing sessions A rigid and repeatable set of instructions should be used to ensure that the tests remain reflective of actual changes in performance

# Isokinetic Measurement

Isokinetic dynamometry has been shown to be valid and reliable method of assessing strength that is sensitive to changes over time and as such is widely used by professional clubs to assess relative strengths across opposing muscle groups and identify potential for injury (see Table 31) (Li et al 1996; Lund et al 2005; Maffiuletti et al 2007; Sole et al 2007; Impellizzeri et al 2008)

Thigh muscle imbalance appears to be an indicator of increased risk of injury (Engstrom and Renstrom 1998) with an imbalance between the hamstrings and quadriceps (eccentric hamstring to concentric quadriceps ratio of less than or equal to 1:1 or conventional concentric hamstring: quadriceps ratio of less than 2:3) indicating increased risk of hamstring injuries (Knapik et al 1991; Yamamoto 1993; Croisier et al 2002; Cameron et al 2003; Foreman et al 2006) and ACL injuries (Holcomb et al 2007) This is due to hamstrings co-contraction during knee flexion which minimizes both anterior and lateral tibial translation (Ahmed et al 2006; Escamilla et al 2001; Kingma et al 2004) decreases shear forces (Li et al 1999) and increases knee stability (Aagaard et al 1998)

The major disadvantage however is that the movements are restricted to single joints and the velocity is usually limited to slow non-functional speeds Furthermore it is useful to know the angles at which these peak forces occur (or at least what the relationship is when the quadriceps are producing peak torque) and how this relationship changes as the velocity of movement increases towards functional speeds

# Isometric Measurement

Isometric strength assessment requires measurement of the static force produced by muscles using dynamometers (usually handgrip or back-lift) This type of assessment may be appropriate for sports

# Aerobic Endurance

The most widely available tests for aerobic endurance are those performed with the minimum of equipment Such tests include those that can be performed ‘in the field’ such as:

- Multi-stage fitness test (MFST) or ‘bleep’ test
- Yo-yo test
- 3-kilometre run
- 5-kilometre run
- 15-mile run
- 12-minute run

Other more sport-specific tests may include time-trials for cycling or rowing for example 10000m row or 20km cycle performed on cycle or rowing ergometer

# Yo-Yo Endurance Test

The yo-yo endurance test appears to have good level of reliability (Castagna et al 2006 2007) (see Table 31) Metaxas et al (2005) also concluded that yo-yo field tests should be used to monitor aerobic fitness in team sports as they are easy to administer and incorporate into training sessions during the competitive season

# Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test

Castagna et al (2006) found that peak VO2 assessed via the yo-yo intermittent endurance test and an incremental treadmill test had no significant relationship ( > 005) indicating that the yo-yo intermittent endurance test is weak predictor of aerobic fitness in moderately trained youth soccer players compared to laboratory assessment Similarly Metaxas et al (2005) found 105–133% variation in VO2 max measurements assessed via the yo-yo endurance test yo-yo intermittent test and continuous and intermittent treadmill tests

However review of literature by Bangsbo et al (2008) concluded that the yo-yo intermittent recovery test is simple and valid method of assessing an individual’s capacity to perform repeated intense exercise bouts and monitoring changes in performance capacity Additional considerations when selecting testing methods are time and reproducibility For team sports the yo-yo test may be far more time-efficient method than individually assessing the whole team and also remains highly reproducible if the testing conditions (clothing equipment time of day warm-up) remain constant If working with marathon runner however the most valid and reliable method of assessing aerobic capacity would be via direct gas analysis For one individual testing duration would be similar whether using direct gas analysis or maximal prediction method such as the yo-yo test

# Graded Exercise Test

A graded exercise test (GXT) in human performance laboratory can reveal greater detail in terms of maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold but it is often the length of time that an athlete lasts in such test that is the best (and simplest) predictor of functional performance ability Graded exercise tests involve progressive increase in exercise intensity and are designed such that the athlete lasts between 10 and 12 minutes before the point of exhaustion These tests must be specific to the athlete’s sport and use large muscle groups

In laboratory the usual criteria for determining VO2 max include:

- A respiratory exchange ratio greater than 115
- Heart rate (HR) in last stage ± 10 beats/min of HRmax
- A plateau in VO2 with increasing work rate

# Needs Analysis for Different Sports

In certain sports particularly those well supported by the literature it is possible to formulate detailed needs analysis Below are example needs analyses for football and rugby league

For sports where the published literature is lacking it is essential that all of the demands of the sport are considered in terms of the demands of the sport as identified earlier in this chapter Initially this needs to focus on the dominant energy system required followed by the velocity of movements force generation and force acceptance direction of force application and development Once these concepts have been decided the rehabilitator can determine the methods of assessment that are essential to test and also which components of fitness/performance need to be prioritized

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

# Needs Analysis for Football

Match analysis reveals that distances covered during 90-minute soccer game range from 9845–11527 metres (Hoff 2005) although distances as great as 13km have been reported (Shephard and Astrand 2000; Bangsbo et al 2006) with average intensity exceeding 70% VO2 max (Bangsbo et al 2006) The distance covered during the game is generally divided between walking (25%) jogging (37%) sub-maximal cruising (20%) sprinting (11%) and moving backwards (7%) (Shephard and Astrand 2000)

The multiple sprints average 10–15 metres (2–4s in duration approximately every 90s) interspersed with jogging walking running backwards and rapid changes in direction There are approximately 50 rapid high-velocity movements in amateurs (Withers et al 1982) and 150–250 rapid high-velocity movements in elite athletes (Bangsbo et al 2006) The rapid high-velocity movements involve high-force eccentric and concentric muscle actions while maintaining balance and control of the ball (Hoff 2005) Fatigue usually occurs during game due to glycogen depletion; however temporary fatigue between multiple short sprints may result from temporary depletion of intramuscular phosphocreatine concentrations (Bangsbo et al 2006)

Average VO2 max measurements of football players appear to be above 60 mlkgmin-1 with individual measures sometimes exceeding 70 mlkgmin-1; average mass and percentage fat are approximately 77 kg and 10% respectively (Reilly et al 2000ab; Arnason et al 2004; Hoff 2005) More specific data is presented in Table 35

It is worth noting that the data in Table 35 is ‘normative’ and not necessarily optimal For example research has shown that increasing VO2 max leads to an increase in performance on the pitch Helgerud et al (2001) found that increasing VO2 max by 10% (581 + 45 to 643 + 39 mlkgmin-1) improved running economy (67%) increased distance covered by 20% increased the number of sprints by 100% and resulted in 24% increase in the number of involvements with the ball

It is also essential to acknowledge that energy expenditure during training sessions and competition has been estimated between 1400 and 1800 kcal dependent on playing position (Reilly et al 2000a; Bangsbo et al 2006) In relation to the energy expenditure during training it is also worth noting that elite squads regularly train twice per day making rapid and efficient replenishment of energy substrates essential

# Football Injuries

When conducting needs analysis it is essential to identify the common injuries and their causes as this may inform the choice of screening tests used to identify injury risk

During two seasons of professional English football it has been shown that the most common types of injuries were hamstring strains and anterior cruciate (ACL) injuries accounting for up to 21% and 8% of all injuries respectively (Hawkins et al 2001; Woods et al 2002 2004) The majority of hamstring injuries in football are non-contact in nature (Hawkins et al 2001; Woods et al 2002 2004; Hagglund et al 2005; Walden et al 2005) highlighting that the risk of injury is intrinsic and may be offset through appropriate conditioning

The literature suggests that there are two non-contact mechanisms responsible for hamstring strain; one resulting from high-speed running (Yamamoto 1993; Woods et al 2004) and the other during stretching movements carried out by extreme range of motion (ROM) (Askling et al 2002) both resulting in high-velocity eccentric loading (Kujala et al 1997; Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004) The strain is most likely to occur during two stages of the running cycle: late forward swing and toe off (Stanton 1989) as at this stage the hamstrings decelerate hip flexion and knee extension (Hoskins and Pollard 2005) resulting in large eccentric loads

In terms of injury prevention these common mechanisms of injury have implications for conditioning It is essential that the hamstrings are conditioned via not only the ‘normal’ concentric emphasized exercises but also via eccentric muscle actions with exercises such as ‘Nordic hamstring lowers’ (see Figure 38a b) which have been shown to decrease the risk of hamstring injury (Askling et al 2003; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Clark et al 2005; Arnason et al 2007) It is also essential to progress on to higher velocity eccentric exercise such as plyometrics (deceleration training) which has also been shown to have beneficial effect in preventing and rehabilitating hamstring strain injuries (Kaminski et al 1998; Brockett et al 2001 2004)

# Assessment and Needs Analysis

It is also worth noting that the incidence of injury during training has been reported to be higher pre-season (42 ± 29 per 1000 hours) compared to during the competitive season (21 ± 22 per 1000 hours) (Hagglund et al 2005; Walden et al 2005)

In summary soccer is sport dominated by short (10–15m) intermittent (every 90s on average) sprints and high-speed changes of direction over an extended period of 90 minutes Normative fitness data appear in Table 32 which also provides guide for suitable methods of assessment of the different components of fitness Training should be targeted to those attributes that enhance sprint and agility performance (including speed strength power and correct deceleration mechanics) cardiovascular endurance to enhance repeated sprint ability and injury prevention with special emphasis on the areas highlighted as deficient following an appropriate battery of fitness tests

# Needs Analysis for Rugby League

During game of rugby league (80 mins) distances covered can be as great as 10000 metres (Meir et al 2001) with the majority of the activity being low intensity activities such as jogging and walking interspersed with high intensity short duration sprints that include periods of high force generation and force acceptance during cutting and turning In contrast to soccer rugby league also includes multiple bouts of high force generation and acceptance due to the number of tackles – up to 40 tackles per game (Brewer and Davis 1995)

Average levels of aerobic capacity have been reported as high as 56 ml/kg/min (Brewer and Davis 1995) with no significant differences between forwards and backs excluding mass; however more specific data is presented in Table 33 In review of literature Gabbett (2005a) found that average heart rates during competition were 78% 84% and 93% of maximum heart rate for amateur semi-professional and professional athletes respectively

It is worth noting that athletes with higher lean mass and more playing experience appear to be preferentially included during team selection (Gabbett 2002b)

To fuel training and performance athletes consume on average 4230 kcal/day (range )

# Nutritional Guidelines for Athletes

The recommended energy intake for athletes is approximately 2671–6917 kcal per day consisting of:

- 6 g/kg/day of carbohydrate
- 2 g/kg/day of protein

Due to the volume of training usually performed by these athletes they may benefit from slightly higher carbohydrate intakes (7–8 g/kg/day) along with slightly lower protein intakes (less than or equal to 16 g/kg/day)

# Rugby Injuries

The most common injuries in rugby league are musculotendinous injuries to the lower limbs The injury statistics are as follows:

- Knee injuries: 80% to 277%
- Hamstring and groin injuries: 80% to 197%
- Ankle injuries: 60% to 124%

Between 388% and 91% of rugby injuries occur due to collisions and tackles which may not be preventable

# Injury Statistics in Junior Rugby League

According to Gabbett (2008) the most common site of injuries in junior rugby league (under 19 years) was:

- Shoulder: 156 per 1000 playing hours
- Knee: 101 per 1000 playing hours

The most common injury type was sprain (247 per 1000 playing hours) Injuries were most commonly sustained while being tackled (192 per 1000 playing hours) and during tackling (101 per 1000 playing hours)

# Performance Requirements in Rugby League

Rugby league requires athletes to cover distances as great as 10000 meters during the 80 minutes of gameplay consisting of:

- Low intensity activities such as jogging and walking
- Interspersed with high intensity short duration sprints cutting and turning
- High levels of impact during an average of 40 tackles per player per game

Training should target attributes that enhance sprint and agility performance including strength power and correct deceleration mechanics as well as cardiovascular endurance to enhance repeated sprint ability and injury prevention Special emphasis should be placed on areas highlighted as deficient following an appropriate battery of fitness tests Unlike soccer strong upper is also required to cope with the forces exerted during high impact tackles

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

# Dr Lee Herrington and Paul Comfort

# University of Salford Greater Manchester

Skeletal muscle injuries are common occurrence especially during sporting activities For example hamstring strains accounted for 21% of injuries reported during two seasons of professional English football (Hawkins et al 2001; Wood et al 2002 2004) The most common injuries reported in rugby league are also musculotendinous injuries to the lower limbs (Hoskins et al 2006) with hamstring and groin injuries making up 80–197% of all reported injuries (Seward et al 1993; Gibbs 1994; Orchard 2004; Gabbett and Domrow 2005)

An understanding of the pathophysiology of muscle injury and repair is essential in order to provide the optimum treatment interventions and to limit injury or re-injury to muscle Reducing the risk of re-injury is an essential component of the rehabilitative process as musculoskeletal injuries such as hamstring strains are compounded by high recurrence rate of 12–31% with approximately 1 in 13 athletes re-injuring within the first year of return to sport (Dadebo et al 2004; Petersen and Holmich 2005; Orchard and Best 2002)

The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the structure and function of skeletal muscle progressing on to the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle injury and repair Developing detailed understanding of this process will help the sports rehabilitator to treat such injuries effectively and efficiently thereby reducing time to return to sport and recurrence of injury The chapter will culminate in case study that will provide the reader with an applied example of this process

# Anatomy

Skeletal muscle consists of both contractile and non-contractile elements The non-contractile elements provide framework for individual muscle cells and encase the nerves and blood vessels (Jarvinen et al 2005) The connective tissue is composed of three levels of sheath: the epimysium dense fibrous sheath surrounding the entire muscle belly; perimysium which binds together muscle fibres to fascicles; and the endomysium which surrounds each muscle fibre (see Figure 41) The connective tissue sheaths are continuous and extend beyond the muscle to myotendinous junctions This means when muscle contracts it pulls on the sheaths which in turn transmit the force to the bone to be moved (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975; Jarvinen et al 2005)

An individual muscle fibre is long cylindrical cell with multiple nuclei bound by its sarcolemma (Lutz and Lieber 1999) The sarcolemma invaginates

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

# Skeletal ("Voluntary") Muscle Anatomy

Skeletal muscle is composed of various connective tissue layers:
- Epimysium: The outer layer of connective tissue located beneath the fascia
- Perimysium: Surrounds fascicles (bundles of muscle fibers)
- Endomysium: Surrounds individual muscle fibers (cells)

# Muscle Fiber Structure

Each muscle fiber contains large number of myofibrils which are the contractile elements of the muscle and consist of protein myofilaments These myofilaments are:
- Actin: Thin filament isotropic forming the I bands
- Myosin: Dark filament anisotropic forming the A bands

It is these bands that give muscle its striated appearance Myofilaments are organized into repeating functional units called sarcomeres In resting muscle the actin filaments overlap the myosin to certain extent

Each myofibril is surrounded by the sarcoplasmic reticulum which serves as store for the release of calcium (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975; Lutz and Lieber 1999)

# Physiology of Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscles are designed to produce voluntary movement by applying forces to bones and joints via muscle contraction When muscle contracts the sarcomeres shorten This process is known as the 'Sliding Filament Theory'

# Pathophysiology of Muscle Injury

# Sliding Filament Theory

The Sliding Filament Theory proposed by Huxley in 1954 describes how myosin filaments remain static while actin filaments slide in and out producing force The A band remains constant length while the I band becomes shorter Force is generated by crossbridges forming between the myosin (via the globular myosin heads) and actin binding sites (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975)

For this process to occur the muscle fiber is stimulated by nerve impulse creating an action potential across the sarcolemma This action potential is propagated down the T-tubules triggering the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum The calcium binds to troponin regulatory protein on the surface of actin exposing the actin binding site A crossbridge is then formed between actin and myosin resulting in contraction cycle powered by ATP Each muscle fiber is part of motor unit so number of muscle fibers are stimulated simultaneously (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975)

# Types of Muscle Injury

There are several types of muscle injury that can occur:

- Laceration: Occurs when the muscle is cut by an external object typically during traumatic accidents such as road traffic or industrial incidents
- Contusion: Results from compressive force to the muscle commonly seen in contact sports (eg football) when players collide such as knee to thigh in tackle
- Strain: Occurs when muscle fibers cannot withstand excessive tensile forces generally associated with eccentric muscle action

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

(Mair et al 1996; Pull and Ranson 2007) Strains most commonly occur in muscles working across two joints eg hamstrings gastrocnemius (Jarvinen et al 2005) during periods of rapid acceleration and deceleration by placing the muscle in lengthened state over two joints and contracting forcefully (Stanton 1989; Farber and Buckwalter 2002; Brockett et al 2004; Hoskins and Pollard 2005; Askling et al 2006 2007a 2007b)

When the muscle is strained the initial injury is usually associated with disruption of the distal myotendinous junction and fibres distal to this but still near the myotendinous junction Injuries to the muscle belly only occur with the application of very high forces The contractile elements are the first tissues to be disrupted; with the surrounding connective tissue not being damaged until high forces are applied (Hasselman et al 1995) The contractile elements are relatively stiff in comparison to the surrounding connective tissue and hence become disrupted at lower forces than the surrounding connective tissue

# Muscle Healing Process

Muscles heal by repair process that can be divided into two phases:

1 Destruction/Injury Phase
2 Repair and Regeneration

# Destruction/Injury Phase

This phase results in damage to the vascular supply and as oxygen can no longer reach the cells they die and release lysosomes (Schiaffino and Partridge 2008) Excessive force to muscle fibre results in tearing of the sarcoplasm and the cells respond by forming contraction band (condensation of cytoskeletal material) creating protective barrier The lysosomes are pivotal in this vital process keeping the necrosis to local area and preventing it from spreading along the whole length of the cell (Jarvinen et al 2005)

Within 15 minutes of injury the damaged tissue consists of disrupted extracellular tissue and dead cells platelets and plasma which themselves release powerful enzymes such as thrombin thereby setting off an inflammatory cascade (Schiaffino and Partridge 2008) A haematoma is formed to fill the gap between ruptured muscle fibres

Clinically tissue inflammation presents as redness heat swelling and pain of the tissues The redness heat and swelling are due to increased blood flow and so blood within vascular beds in the area with the swelling developing as result of the increased local tissue pressure due to inflammatory exudates (local capillaries become more permeable) leaking into the interstitial space (Schiaffino and Partridge 2008) The pain is due to the initial damage to local nerves and irritation of nerves in the area from the inflammatory chemicals released by the damaged tissue (Evans 1980)

# Repair and Regeneration

After the initial injury the inflammatory chemicals released from the injured tissues attract lymphocytes and macrophages to the area (Jarvinen et al 2005) Macrophage phagocytosis of the necrotic material then occurs removing the debris (Tidball and Wehling-Henricks 2007) The regeneration process starts within 3–6 days following injury reaching peak between day 7 and 14 The regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle is provided by satellite cells specialized cells underneath the basal lamina of each muscle fibre In response to injury they proliferate and differentiate into myoblasts and then become multinucleated myotubes (Jarvinen et al 2005) These then fuse with parts of the muscle fibre that have survived the initial injury and attempt to bridge the gap in the muscle (Lieber and Friden 2002)

Recent findings have shown that bone marrow stem cells may play role in contributing to regenerating muscle fibres and replenishing the satellite cells; however it is debatable as to how big role this is (Gates and Huard 2005; Jarvinen et al 2005)

At the same time as myotubes are attempting to cross the injury site fibrin is being laid down creating an irregular meshwork of short fibres by the fibroblasts which have differentiated from the macrophages drawn to the area earlier in the process This acts as connective tissue scaffold (Schiaffino and Partridge 2008) This irregular fibrin network obviously reduces the ability of the myotubes to cross the rupture and make good an effective contractile unit It is possible to minimize the irregular nature of this connective tissue mesh and also the amount present by applying suitable tensile loads (ie not high enough to cause re-rupture) (Lehto et al 1985)

This regeneration process can occur rapidly; within 10 days post-injury the injured muscle can regain much of its contractile ability with progressively applied loading set at levels below the pain threshold (Nikolaou et al 1987)
---
# Treatment of Muscle Injuries

It is frequently cited within the sports medicine literature that the initial treatment of musculoskeletal injuries should be rest ice compression and elevation (RICE) However this acronym is likely to be more valid in the less metabolically active tissues such as ligament and bone (Gates and Huard 2005) Muscle with its capacity for rapid regeneration due to the nature of its constituent tissues requires modified approach (Peterson and Holmich 2005; Thorsson et al 2007) This modification is based around the balance between absolute rest and the absolute level of loading to stimulate appropriately the rapidly developing tissues

# Rest and Mobilisation

Early mobilisation rather than immobilisation or complete rest has been advocated (Thorsson et al 2007) Studies have shown early mobilisation aids with regeneration of muscle fibres (stimulation of satellite cells and myotube formation improves capillary growth into the area and aids with more parallel orientation of collagen and muscle fibres (Nikolaou et al 1987 Taylor et al 1993; Goldspink 1999) The exact level of loading is difficult to judge; it must be sufficient to stimulate and challenge the developing tissues but not so great that it causes tissue breakdown (Kannus et al 2002) This includes early weight bearing to help promote scar tissue re-alignment (Croisier 2004; Jarvinen et al 2005) and controlled running to reduce muscle inhibition (Herrington 2000)

Immobilisation and poorly controlled early loading (low or high) have been shown to lead to the development of contracted scar tissue which blocks the linking of myotubes across the injury thereby stopping the formation of functional contractile element and the surrounding areas then become more susceptible to further injury (Beiner and Jokl 2001; Lehto et al 1985)

# Ice

Studies have shown that ice results in significantly smaller haematoma and less inflammation in the initial stages of the injury (Jarvinen et al 2005) Reducing tissue temperature results in vasoconstriction thereby limiting the amount of bleeding in the area (Beiner and Jokl 20012) It also reduces the metabolic rate of the tissue and therefore reduces the demand for oxygen (Hubbard et al 2004) decreasing the hypoxic damage

Clinical studies have shown the optimal duration to apply ice is for 5–10 minutes in the initial stages and repeat every 60 minutes (Croisier 2004; Hubbard et al 2004) within the first 24–48 hours to reduce the inflammatory effects

# Compression and Elevation

Compression is an area where research is lacking; it has been stated that it results in reduction in the severity of bleeding and swelling following an injury (Kannus et al 2002; Jarvinen et al 2005) though the only evidence often present in support of this theory is from studies involving ligament injuries A recent clinical study by Thorsson et al (2007) utilising 40 athletes with calf injuries found compression resulted in no significant difference in reducing muscle haematoma or speed of recovery of the injury using compression

Elevation is still one of the preferred and easiest methods of immediate management used in sports medicine for muscular injuries (Hergenroeder 1998) It simply relies on the use of gravity to promote venous return and lymphatic flow to drive swelling/oedema from the area (Hergenroeder 1998) Again research is lacking in this area with most authors when citing research using studies on ankle ligament injuries and even here the actual positive benefits when the limb is dependent again are very limited (Tsang et al 2003) It would appear that the greatest benefit that comes from compression and elevation is that it ensures that the athlete rests during the acute inflammatory phase of the first 72 hours following injury

# Strengthening Exercise

Isometric exercise can begin after 2–5 days and should be performed within the limits of pain (Jarvinen et al 2005) Frequency duration and intensity are limited by the patient’s pain Some therapists advocate three sets of 10 repetitions using 5–10 second holds to begin with at intensity within pain tolerance (Pull and Ranson 2007) These then are undertaken at multiple angles beginning in mid-range then progressing to inner range (shortened position)

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

Once these can be undertaken in pain-free manner throughout the available range then isotonic exercises can commence Dynamic movement and isotonic contraction is then incorporated again starting in the strongest position (mid range close to 90° joint angle) progressing to and finishing in the functionally most relevant (outer range with eccentric and concentric contractions most often)

There is preferential atrophy of type 1 muscle fibres with disuse (Stockmar et al 2006) and high loads and rates of force development are most likely to over-stress the healing tissue Therefore initially an endurance based programme should be used (three sets of 15 repetitions at 40–60% of one repetition maximum) this would be progressed to strength (4–6 sets of 3–6 repetitions at 85–95% of one repetition maximum and then power training (3–5 sets of 3-5 repetitions at 75–85% of one repetition maximum) (Kraemer et al 2002) or plyometrics depending on the specific requirements of the muscle The exact nature of the progressions directions and velocity of movement will depend on which muscle has been injured and the requirements of the sport as will whether or not the progressions have major stability/proprioception element

Within the certain muscles can be regarded as having role that is predominately about the generation of force/power and they tend to work mostly in single plane (usually the sagittal) these are often called mobiliser muscles Other muscles can be regarded as having stability role they control motion of the and often have the ability to contract in multiple planes; they are often called stabiliser muscles

# Table 41: Examples of Different Muscle Roles

|Mobiliser Muscles|Stabiliser Muscles|
|---|---|
|Hamstrings|Gluteus medius/minimus|
|Quadriceps|Adductor longus|
|Gastrocnemius|Tibialis posterior|
|Pectoralis major|Infraspinatus|
|Latissimus dorsi|Subscapularis|

The nature of the role of the muscles affects the choice of rehabilitation exercise we will choose towards the end stage of rehabilitation Power/mobiliser muscles do not have stability role and so will not require exercise progressions that involve proprioceptive challenge whereas the stabiliser muscles will Similarly those muscles that predominantly work in an open kinetic chain manner will not require exercise progressions involving closed kinetic chain exercises

# Stretching

Passive stretching (at the end of available range) should be avoided for the first 72 hours as minimal period possibly the athlete should not stretch for the first 7–10 days following injury (Neidlinger-Wilke et al 2002) The reasons for this are twofold Firstly the healing tissue is weak and intolerant of tensile loading and so is likely to be damaged by uncontrolled stretching The second reason is there is no physiological need in the early stages to stretch as the scar does not begin to shrink until around the tenth day post injury when fibroblasts begin to be converted to myofibroblasts and contract and draw the wound ends together Prior to the tenth day post injury it would be more appropriate to take the muscle through its full available pain-free range without any attempt to force the muscle beyond this point

Once it is appropriate to begin stretching the muscle; that is elongating the tissue beyond its available range then careful passive stretching can be performed Each stretch should be held at the end of available range within the limits of pain Time frequency duration and intensity of stretch remain debatable in the literature Some research suggests passive stretching should be held for minimum of 15 seconds with 6–8 sets per day (Roberts and Wilson 1999) however Bandy et al (1997) reviewed stretches at 15 seconds 30 seconds and 60 seconds They determined that 30 seconds was the optimum duration also stating that longer periods after 30 seconds were ineffective in promoting additional stretch

As with strengthening exercises stretching exercises need to be progressed in order that the tissue adapts to the different types of load once the athlete is comfortable (pain free) with passive stretching (Bandy et al 1997)

# Muscle Injury (Hamstring)

# Example of Muscle Injury (Hamstring)

Vascularised tissues such as skeletal muscle (Robertson and Baker 2001) It is thought to work at the cell membrane level resulting in an ‘up regulation’ of cellular behaviour This results in an improved rate of oedema dispersion resolution of the inflammatory process and promotes more rapid rate of fibrin fibre orientation and deposition of collagen (Robertson and Baker 2001)

Another modality that can be used to help speed up recovery from muscle injury is therapeutic ultrasound This is the use of high intensity sound waves which research has shown can help recovery of tissues at cellular level by increasing ion transport across cells and increasing metabolism within the cell (Wilkin et al 2003) and increasing fibroblastic and angiogenic activity (ter-Haar et al 1978) However evidence-based research remains limited in the effectiveness and reliability of therapeutic ultrasound treatment with the majority of supporting evidence coming from in-vitro cell culture studies (Robertson 2002) even though many clinicians still use it as their main electrotherapy treatment

Muscle stimulation may prove further useful electrotherapeutic adjunct for the treatment of muscle injuries It has been shown to decrease oedema muscle inhibition and the rate of strength loss with inactivity (Thornton et al 1998) However muscle stimulation has not been shown to be useful in the regaining of strength in the injured athlete (Snyder-Mackler et al 1995)

# Other Factors

As discussed earlier management of muscle injuries includes prevention of re-injury For example with hamstring injuries many factors have been cited in literature as potential causes of re-injury These include:

- Previous injury (Verall et al 2001; Crossier et al 2002 2003; Arnason et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)
- Lack of flexibility (Knapik et al 1991; Hennessey and Watson 1993; Jonhagen et al 1994; Bennell et al 1998; Cross and Worrell 1999; Witvrouw et al 2000; Funk et al 2001; Brockett et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)
- Inadequate warm-up (Worrell 1994; Worrell et al 1994)
- Fatigue (Worrell 1994; Worrell et al 1994)
- Muscle strength imbalance (Knapik et al 1991; Yamamoto 1993; Cameron et al 2003; Crossier et al 2003; Foreman et al 2006)
- Poor coordination (Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)

Hamstring strains have also been associated with eccentric loading (Kujala et al 1997; Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004) such as during rapid deceleration

An understanding of the mechanics of the sport can be helpful in analysing the cause of the injury in the first place This information can normally be revealed during the initial subjective assessment of the athlete using simple questioning such as ‘how did the injury happen can you demonstrate (without re-injuring of course)’

# Example of Muscle Injury (Hamstring)

Hamstring strains are one of the most common injuries in sport and can result in lengthy period out of the game if not treated effectively (Clark et al 2005) The hamstring is two-joint muscle and is most susceptible to injury in sports involving sprinting and kicking (Stanton 1989; Brockett et al 2004; Hoskins and Pollard 2005; Askling et al 2006) The majority of injuries occur in the biceps femoris and at the musculotendinous junction although they can also occur to the semimembranosus during stretching (Askling et al 2007b)

# Mechanism of Injury

As stated earlier injury often occurs during sprinting and the point of failure has been shown to occur in the terminal swing phase just prior to foot strike This is when the hamstrings have to work eccentrically to decelerate the tibia and control knee extension (Clark et al 2005) Hamstring strains are commonly reported in sprinters when speed is maximal or close to maximal (Askling et al 2006) and during powerful eccentric muscle actions (Brockett et al 2004) The strain is most likely to occur during two phases of the running cycle: late forward swing and toe off (Stanton 1989) as during this phase the hamstrings decelerate hip flexion and knee extension (Hoskins and Pollard 2005) resulting in large eccentric loads It has also been found that whilst sprinters sustain their injuries during high-speed running dancers sustain injuries whilst performing slow stretching type exercises (Askling et al 2006) In activities such as dancing most hamstring injuries occur during stretching (hip flexion with knee extension) (Askling et al 2006 2007a 2007b) resulting in

# Predisposing Factors

The predisposing factors of hamstring strain injury are multifactorial including:

- Poor lumbar posture (Hennessey and Watson 1993)
- Previous injury (Crossier et al 2003; Arnason et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)
- Lack of flexibility (Knapik et al 1991; Hennessey and Watson 1993; Bennell et al 1998; Kaminski et al 1998; Cross and Worrell 1999; Funk et al 2001; Brockett et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)
- Inadequate warm-up (Worrell 1994; Worrell and Smith 1994)
- Fatigue (Worrell 1994; Worrell and Smith 1994)
- Strength imbalance and inadequate quadriceps to hamstring ratio (Knapik et al 1991; Cameron et al 2003; Crossier et al 2003; Foreman et al 2006)
- Poor coordination (Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)

The length of the muscle when peak torque is produced has also been postulated as predisposing factor with the hypothesis that the greater the knee extension angle at which peak torque is produced the lower the risk of injury (Clark et al 2005)

The literature suggests that there are two types of hamstring strain: one resulting from high-speed running as in football (Woods et al 2004) and athletics (Yamamoto 1993) and the other during stretching movements carried out at extreme range of motion (ROM) (Askling et al 2002)

Reported causes of hamstring strains include:

- Poor lumbar posture (Hennessey and Watson 1993)
- Previous injury (Verall et al 2001; Crossier et al 2002; Arnason et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)
- Lack of flexibility (Hennessey and Watson 1993; Funk et al 2001; Brockett et al 2004; Jonhagen et al 1994; Cross et al 1999; Witvrouw et al 2000; Bennell et al 1998; Foreman et al 2006; Knapik et al 1991)
- Inadequate warm-up (Worrell 1994; Worrell et al 1994)
- Fatigue (Worrell 1994; Worrell et al 1994)
- Strength imbalance and inadequate quadriceps to hamstring ratio (Knapik et al 1991; Crossier et al 2003; Yamamoto 1993; Cameron et al 2003; Foreman et al 2006)
- Poor coordination (Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004; Foreman et al 2006)

Hamstring strains have also been associated with eccentric loading (Kujala et al 1997; Cameron et al 2003; Brockett et al 2004) such as during rapid deceleration

# Symptoms

Hamstring strains can often be diagnosed by the mechanism of injury resulting in sudden onset of pain The patient presents with:

- Reduced hamstrings contraction against resistance
- Reduced stretch
- Local bruising/haematoma
- Pain on palpation
- Difficulties in walking
- Inability to run or sprint (Croisier et al 2002)

# Treatment

Acute management includes:

- Relative rest
- Ice
- Compression
- Elevation to reduce inflammation and provide an optimal environment for repair (Thorsson et al 2007)

Gentle stretches and early weight bearing can also be commenced within the pain-free range to assist with correct fibre orientation (Bandy et al 1994 1997 1998; Goldspink 1999; Sherry and Best 2004; Peterson and Holmich 2005)

Localized soft tissue techniques including cryotherapy in the acute phase (Herrington 2000; Hubbard et al 2004) and electrotherapy once the acute phase has settled aid in the reduction of muscle spasm and help soft tissue repair (Herrington 2000; Robertson and Baker 2001) In particular ultrasound may be used to assist in the breakdown of scar tissue and promotion of tissue healing and is interferential in the reduction of swelling and inflammation (Wilkin et al 2004)

Strengthening exercises are vital to try to prevent further injury initially starting with isometric and progressing onto isotonic as pain allows (Jarvinen et al 2005) As injury is most likely to occur during eccentric activity it is vital that eccentric exercise is incorporated into the programme in the later stages The Nordic eccentric exercise has been shown to improve the torque angle at the knee and rugby union teams that incorporated it into their training programmes found reduced number of hamstring strains (Kujala et al 1997; Clark et al 2005; Brooks et al 2006; Gabbe et al 2006; Arnason et al 2008)

Eccentric training programmes should be closely monitored as they can lead to delayed onset muscle soreness; low volume (3–5 sets of three repetitions) high frequency (3–4 times week) may be most appropriate

Exercises are then progressed to functional activities (eg running/sprint training) with return to sport once there is full strength and pain-free movement

# Rehabilitation and Prevention of Skeletal Muscle Injuries

# Rehabilitation

As discussed earlier sports specific rehabilitation is vital to return the athlete back to their functional sport Not only can this return the athlete back to sport quicker but help prevent further injury later on Functional fitness must also be maintained throughout the rehabilitation process without aggravating the injury Examples could include cycling walking upper weights and swimming so long as these are pain-free (Croisier et al 2002) This would not be functional for most sports but may be useful in reducing the detraining effect regularly associated with reduction in training volume and intensity following injury

It can be seen that rehabilitation therapists have vital role to play in preventing and treating injuries to skeletal muscle

# Prevention

There are number of factors that can predispose to skeletal muscle injury and if these can be controlled/prevented then the risk of injury will be reduced Examples may include adequate warm-up and stretches prior to sports participation; conditioning programme consisting of eccentric plyometric sports specific and cardiovascular exercise; and optimum treatment following previous injury (Kujala et al 1997; Herrington 2000; Clark et al 2005; Brooks et al 2006; Gabbe et al 2006; Arnason et al 2008)

As an example hamstring injury in football can be caused by running/sprint deceleration activity which incorporates eccentric control of the hamstring muscle at higher speeds This eccentric control of muscle must be re-implemented within the rehabilitation programme once the initial injury is managed in order to rehabilitate the fibre reorientation and to help reorganise the neuromuscular pathways which control the activity at such speed (Marqueste et al 2004)

Therefore sports specific rehabilitation may involve sprinting over short distances with sudden stopping and resprinting in another direction over many repetitions in order to mimic the control required for football To begin with this may require slower timed sessions and as time progresses this process is speeded up to match speed This not only helps recruit the right muscle fibre type but also helps restore proprioception and regain functional fitness

Fatigue has also been shown to be precursor to injury as fatigued muscle is not able to absorb as much energy prior to failure due to reduced ability to generate force (Mair et al 1996) Therefore rehabilitation should also be geared towards increasing the duration of rehabilitation sessions and trying to maintain fitness even with injury

# Summary Key Points of Muscle Healing and Rehabilitation

- RICE should be implemented as soon as possible following acute injury
- Early mobilisation and weight bearing should also be encouraged
- Stretching and strength exercises can start within pain-free range as soon as possible
- Fitness and conditioning of the athlete should be incorporated within the early rehabilitation programme without compromising the injury
- Specificity and functional fitness are imperative to help return the athlete back to sport without recurrence

# Tendons - Chapter Overview

# Tendons

# Dr Stephen Pearson

# University of Salford Greater Manchester

# Introduction

Tendons are an important link in the locomotor system enabling muscle forces to be utilized to perform complex movements and actions As such their characteristics can affect the ability to generate appropriate forces when attempting for example fine motor tasks or indeed those tasks requiring high rates of force development In order to be able to respond to these demands the tendon is designed to be both rigid enough to enable efficient transfer of forces from muscle to bone but also compliant enough to allow storage of energy for later use

It is because of these diverse requirements on the tendon that they are frequently at risk of injury both acutely where perhaps force has been applied in an unusual or inappropriate fashion or chronically where micro damage has accumulated over time leading to trauma

This chapter will outline the tendon physiology from molecular level to gross tissue level and how this relates to its function and its subsequent mechanical properties The tendon characteristics are then put in context of the action of muscle and ultimately the ability to produce functional force Next tendon injury will be discussed in context of its use both from an acute and also chronic perspective The ability of the tendon to regenerate and optimal or appropriate healing strategies will also be put into context and illustrated by appropriate case studies

# Basic Tendon Anatomy and Physiology

Tendon gross structure can be described as either sheet-like or rounded Some tendinous structures may be combination of both with the tendon being more rounded in the mid portion and tending to resemble sheet-like fascia at their attachments (aponeuroses) with the adjoining muscle Within the tendon there is structure consisting of closely packed collagen molecules which are assembled into fibrils fibres fibre bundles or sub fascicles fascicles and tertiary fibre bundles

This arrangement of collagens into hierarchical structure enables the tendon to resist tensile loading and ensures that there is minimal risk of catastrophic rupture Each fibre bundle is wrapped with layer of connective tissue called the endotenon; blood vessels nerves and lymphatic elements can pass through this layer to supply the tendon The tendon is covered by an outer layer of connective tissue called the epitenon; this is contiguous with the layer below (endotenon) Most tendons are then covered with looser outer layer paratenon; this tissue is lined with synovial cells and allows for tendon movement or gliding

Tendon consists of tendon cells (fibroblasts) that lie in longitudinal rows and are elongated cells extending within the tendon structure and communicate via gap junctions within the three-dimensional space of the tendon Also there is the extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms the scaffold for the tendon

# Tendons - Physio Knowledge

# Tendons

The tendon consists of range of collagens (I II III V VI IX and XI) proteoglycans and water The largest proportion of collagen contained in tendon is type I which lends strength to the tendon structure whereas the proteoglycans give the tendon its viscoelastic properties

It is now well known that tendon is metabolically active tissue and adapts readily to influences such as mechanical loading and unloading (Heinemeier et al 2009) This can be understood as dynamic mechanism responding to feedback signaling via mechanotransduction pathways in an attempt to optimize the tissue characteristics to its function Previous work has shown that tendon adapts to loading by modifying its mechanical properties and dimensions Similarly it has been observed that tendon mechanical properties such as compliance are increased with unloading due to regulation of structural proteins ie collagens In line with this is the observation that tendon elastic properties are associated with the attached muscle (Muraoka et al 2005) in that muscle that is able to generate large force will generally be attached to tendon that has adapted to cope with these forces

The mechanisms of how the tendon responds to mechanical signals at cellular level are still not well understood but are thought to involve the transduction of mechanical stressors via the extracellular matrix (ECM) The ECM forms the substrate for the anchoring of cells and enables the tendon to maintain its structural integrity It has been suggested that forces generated end to end along the tendon are transferred along it by the matrix in shear connecting along the length of the discontinuous collagen fibres (Ker 1999)

Components called integrins which are described as heterodimeric transmembrane proteins cell surface receptors that connect the tendon ECM to the cytoskeleton Thus these are part of the adhesion complex forming adhesion foci complexes at the cell membrane and are thought to be involved in the complex signaling processes resulting in modifications of structural proteins These molecules when activated (for example via mechanical stress) can initiate chemical signaling cascade processes such as tyrosine phosphorylation nuclear factor transcription factor (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation either directly or as part of the process involving other growth factors

Another ECM molecule that is receiving some attention is tenascin C; this is also seen to be upregulated with mechanical stimulus and is ligand for integrin The actual role of tenascin in tendon tissue is as yet not clear but may involve actions related to tissue remodeling and general maintenance of the intercellular structures enabling gliding of bordering collagen bundles (Riley et al 1996)

How integrins sense strain is not clear in that although conformational changes are seen when

# Functional Aspects of Tendon

Tendon is sited between the muscle and bone and acts to transmit forces generated by the muscle to the bone to enable movement The forces experienced by tendons are usually tensile although due to their arrangements with the bony anatomy tendons may also experience compressive and shear forces For example tendon can glide over bony areas to allow moment arms to be utilized potentially increasing torque transmitted via the tendon The tensile properties of tendon allow for its capacity to resist rupture under normal loading conditions

Tendon is described as having viscoelastic qualities These properties enable the tendon to act both as damper to reduce potentially damaging high forces but also as storage medium for energy generated during movement

It is usual to describe the tendon response to loading in terms of strain (percentage change of length from rest) and stress (force per unit area) A typical stress–strain curve for human tendon can be seen in Figure 53

# Functional Aspects of Tendon

With respect to the strain tendon has the characteristics of larger strain at low load due in part to the crimp structure of the collagen fibrils and linear region where strain is proportional to stress Beyond this point the tendon starts to become plastic in that it takes on new resting length when the load is removed If stress continues to be applied then ultimately tendon rupture will result Tendons with less crimp have been observed to fail before those with more pronounced tendon crimp pattern (Wilmink et al 1992) This may be reflective of the mechanical connections between the collagen fibrils and the ECM or some qualitative differences in the collagen structure

Regarding the ultimate tensile stress for tendon tissue conservative limit has been suggested of 100 MPa (Bennett et al 1986) However Johnson et al (1994) examined human patellar tendons and estimated that the ultimate tensile strength was 65 ± 15 MPa for young subjects

Ker (2002) discusses ‘stress for life’ where functional stress is determined from the ratios of the tendon to the muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and the product of the maximal isometric stress developed by the muscle (03 MPa Wells 1965) with ranges from 8–100 MPa but more normally approximating 13 MPa It can be seen then that in certain circumstances tendon may be subjected to stress which may be nearing its rupture limit For example the patellar tendon has been reported to be subjected to approximately 122 kN during actions such as competitive weightlifting (Zernicke et al 1977) but under normal circumstances there is relatively large margin of safety This is perhaps best illustrated by considering the tendons involved in locomotion such as the Achilles; it has been determined that this structure may experience forces in the order of 7 kN during running (Komi et al 1992) which equates to approximately 85 times mass for an individual of mass 80 kg This may be even greater during actions such as long jump or triple jumping and has been reported to be in the order of 9 kN during jumping (Komi 1990)

However with regard to tendinous damage it is more likely generally that tendons suffer what is termed fatigue damage resulting from repeated loading cycles (see on Chronic tendon injury) Tendon has been shown to become damaged at strain values approximating 15% (Stäubli et al 1999) although these values have been previously reported to be as high as 30% (Haut and Pawlison 1990) A functional design aspect of tendon to help limit damage is that of the ability of the tendon fascicles to slide with respect to each other whilst simultaneously transmitting forces along the tendon length

With respect to strain it has previously been shown that there are qualitative differences between male and female tendon with females having greater compliance in comparison to males (Onambele et al 2007)

# Tendons

Response to acute stretch in females shows larger decreases in tendon stiffness in contrast to males This may have implications where stretching is used as part of warm-up (Burgess et al 2009a) This may reflect differences in the collagen content and/or composition between males and females These gender differences do not seem to be retained in elderly tendon however (Burgess et al 2009b) possibly reflecting the changing hormonal influences on tendon being less disparate between the genders with age and more similarities in lifestyle

At the levels of loading seen routinely tendon may suffer micro damage at levels of strain seen normally that is below 10% leading to accumulated deterioration in tendon (see on Chronic tendon injury) Normal ranges of strain under conditions of maximal isometric contraction for human tendon structures are within the ranges of 6–14% The range of normalized elasticity (Young’s modulus) for tendon is approximately 08–2 GPa

This property represents the normalized (corrected for differences in tendon length and cross-) stiffness of the tissue and is the gradient of the stress-strain curve

As tendons are also elastic they tend to stretch when muscle contraction takes place If for example the external load is very heavy then as the muscle contracts the tendon may stretch initially The action of the tendon here could be thought of as similar to spring being stretched and energy stored This may be functionally important; an example of this could be where an athlete is sprinting or jumping and the tendon is being subjected to stretch-shortening cycles This enables the movement to be carried out with higher efficiency than if the tendon did not stretch and then shorten in that the tendon is initially storing energy during the stretch to be released during the shortening or recoil period

It has been reported that tendon has the ability to return approximately 93% of its stored energy during the recoil phase the rest being lost as heat energy (Alexander 2002) This particular property of tendon is perhaps useful where cyclical movements are being carried out with changes in kinetic and potential energy or to increase the power component as in jumping The tendon can act to help smooth out these changes and store some of the energy as elastic strain energy to be returned to the system when required reducing the overall work required for the muscles (ie running) However where high rates of force development are required tendon compliance could be seen as potentially detrimental to optimal performance

The mechanical properties of the tendon in particular the stiffness can also be seen to potentially affect the characteristics of muscle contraction A muscle’s contractile ability in part is described by its length-tension curve by which the number of elements that generate muscle force (cross bridges) are increased or decreased depending on the muscle length (see Figure 55) Here it can be seen that if the tendon is compliant and stretches under load the muscle will shorten and this could affect its ability to generate force As can be seen from Figure 55 if the muscle is starting from position near maximal force and the tendon stretches the muscle will shorten moving down the force-generating curve

The position where the tendon attaches to bone can have functional implications A muscle can only extend or shorten over given range; the points at which tendon attaches to the bone can thus affect the movement of the limb to which the muscle-tendon complex is attached This can be seen to be useful from functional standpoint where for example force is preferred over range of movement and vice versa (see Figure 56 for example) Here where the tendon attaches closer to the joint center of rotation as in Figure 56A the limb being affected can move further for given muscle shortening than where the tendon attaches further from the rotation center (Figure 56B) This is at cost of reduced torque generating ability

# Tendon Injury and Its Management

Tendon injury can be debilitating in so far as damaged tendon will likely reduce the capacity for transfer of forces via the muscle to the bone This has obvious implications for range of activities

# Acute Tendon Injury

# Acute Tendon Injury

# Overview

Acute tendon injuries can be identified due to extrinsic factors such as direct contact with an external or accidental unaccustomed loading such as extreme shear However the majority of acute tendon injuries show prior predisposing factors which can be chronic inflammatory or accumulative degenerative conditions that may be undetected prior to the acute trauma

# Characteristics of Tendon Injury

Injury to the tendon can be characterized as acute resulting in either catastrophic rupture or less major tear of the tendon tissue Alternatively the tendon may suffer chronic pathological changes which may be inflammatory or not even detectable These factors can affect the tendon at numerous sites along its length

# Types of Acute Tendon Injury

Immediate tendon injury can be described as either complete rupture of the tendinous structure or partial rupture A complete rupture will be self-evident and accompanied by loss of function pain and swelling usually following the incident On inspection it may be obvious that rupture has occurred as gap may be seen where the tendon would normally be More specific diagnosis of rupture can be carried out using imaging techniques such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging

Tendon injuries of this nature tend to be unilateral and of those reported for the Achilles tendon 75% were related specifically to sport The tendons most commonly suffering rupture are those bearing higher functional loads such as the Achilles and patellar tendons

# Overview

Tendon rupture has also been previously suggested to be associated with hypovascular regions of the tendon For example achilles tendon ruptures typically occur 2–6 cm proximal to the insertion site at the calcaneus This area along with the insertion site is also known to be poorly supplied with blood (Carr and Norris 1989; Niculescu and Matusz 1988)

# Causes

There are number of factors which are thought to be responsible for acute tendon injury These factors can be separated into intrinsic and extrinsic factors

A sudden large force or torque applied through the tendon perhaps at an oblique angle could result in partial or complete tear How this force or torque presents may be due to either environmental factors – incorrect or accidental placement of the limbs in context of the surface abnormal surface conditions – and/or neural control mechanism failure which may be accompanied by inappropriate muscle balance It is also suggested that in number of acute injuries to the tendon prior predisposing pathological factors may have been present Here when strenuous activity is routinely carried out it is possible that cumulative damage may occur leading to catastrophic failure of the tissue (Järvinen et al 2001)

It has been reported that males present with tendon injuries more often than females; however it is not clear if this is due to more participation in sport by males and thus more exposure to risk of injury (Clayton and Court-Brown 2008) Onambele et al (2007) demonstrated qualitative differences between male and female tendons in young adults with females having more compliant structures Whether this would result in tendon more likely to be injured is not clear; however if the two tendon structures have similar strain limits it might be suggested that for given force the female tendon would be more likely to undergo permanent deformation and subsequent damage

More recently it has been reported that certain classes of drugs including antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) and corticosteroids can affect the collagen tissue directly leading to weakened structures that may rupture under high loading conditions (Sode et al 2007) The mechanism by which fluoroquinolones are thought to increase the risk of tendon injury is linked to the increased activation of metalloproteinase regulator of collagen degradation

There has been suggested association between anabolic steroids use and tendon injury Of the studies carried out in animal models there have been reports of morphological changes to the collagen structures In humans however this has not been shown Evans et al (1998) examined tendon tissue from individuals who had self-administered anabolic steroids for between 1 and 10 years Subsequent light and electron microscopy analysis of the tendon indicated no differences from normal There is some initial case study evidence to suggest there is an association between steroid use and tendon rupture One such case involved an individual presenting with relatively rare case of bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture which was subsequently suggested to be associated with the earlier intake of anabolic steroids (Liow and Tavares 1995) Regarding the mechanism responsible for injury with the intake of steroids it may be that as the ability to generate high forces increases due to the anabolic effects on muscle the tendon simply cannot keep pace with this increased ability and therefore succumbs to injury

Previously Unverferth and Olix (1973) showed in number of cases involving athletes who had received localized corticoid steroid injection of the tendon that there was an association with the use of corticosteroid and subsequent tendon rupture A series of experiments on animal tendons led them to suggest this may have been due to resultant disruption of the tendon collagen matrix and this was aligned with reduced modulus of elasticity for those tendons

# Chronic Tendon Injury

# Chronic Tendon Injury

# Recent Evidence

Recent evidence has indicated that there may be link between certain specific gene polymorphisms and tendon injury Mokone et al (2005 2006) showed relationship between the COL5A1 and tenascin C gene and Achilles tendon injury rates These genes are important to the structural integrity of tendon as the COL5A1 gene is known to code for collagen structural components whereas the tenascin C gene encodes for the extracellular matrix component tenascin C This component is understood to be involved with the transmission of forces throughout the tendon and is component that is upregulated in response to mechanical loading suggesting role in tendon remodeling

# Repair and Rehabilitation

With respect to the optimal method for repair and subsequent rehabilitation treatment of tendon ruptures no consensus exists Although there is increasing evidence to suggest that where individuals are relatively active and able surgery may be advantageous providing better functional capacity over non-operative options (Schepsis et al 2002); whereas for those who are more sedentary less invasive non-operative treatments may be advocated The following case study illustrates the use of recent methodology to aid in the repair of ruptured rotator cuff tendon Here patient underwent surgery involving the use of “cascade membrane” to knit the tendon and accelerate healing The membrane consisted of thin layer of autologous fiber saturated in platelets the idea being that platelets are responsible for the production of growth factors responsible for promoting healing Here the membrane provided both mechanical strength to allow connection of the tendon ends and an environment for optimal healing After surgery the patient was immobilized for period of four weeks and standard rotator cuff rehabilitation protocol was carried out MRI examination of the repair after six months indicated complete and robust repair of the ruptured tendon (Maniscalco et al 2008)

# Definitions

There are number of definitions for chronic tendon pathological changes generally associated with increased tendon usage These range from terms to describe degeneration and the failing of the healing response to those used to describe inflammation and morphological adaptation of the tendon tissue A more general and suitable clinical term that does not attempt to describe the pathologies associated with the condition has been suggested as “tendinopathy” (Mafulli et al 1998)

# Causes

Tendinopathy can be directly associated with the volume or intensity of tendon loading which can be modified by other factors such as age gender (Aström et al 1998; Riley et al 2001) mass disease and oral contraceptives in females (Holmes and Lin 2006) Where loading is inappropriate the tendon may suffer continual minor damage from which it is not able to recover for any number of reasons leading to eventual clinical signs of injury or damage As mechanism for ‘non-coping’ tendons the vasculature supplying the tendon may have part to play Here the blood supply is required to provide requisite healing components as part of the process If this system is not able to carry out this task optimally the tendon may not recover from the trauma Previously poorly perfused tendon tissue has been linked with spontaneous tendon ruptures (Yepes et al 2008) Interestingly though tendinopathy shows hypervascularization of the tendon without an associated healing response; this contrast is difficult to explain and may be indicative of breakdown of the cascade system responsible for normal healing This increased vascularization has been reported to be responsible for the pain associated with tendinopathy (Alfredson et al 2003)

Recently researchers have suggested that insertional overuse injuries may be characterized by compressive forces rather than tensile loading Here the suggestion is that the change from tensile to compressive loading at the tendon origin during knee flexion could result in adaptations of the tendon structure making it more susceptible to injury (Johnson et al 1996; Hamilton and Purdam 2004) However recent study investigating the aetiology of patellar jumper’s knee reported that forces present at the patellar origin site were in fact tensile in nature showing that patellar strain increased with loading but also that tendon strain increased with decreased patellar-patellar tendon angle (Lavagnino et al 2008) The minimal patellar-patellar tendon angle was also shown to coincide with predictions of knee angle for maximal

# Understanding Tendinopathy

Although inflammation is common to injury it is generally thought that tendinopathy is not associated with inflammation Tendons typically present as painful and histological degenerative changes are evident such as increased cellularity and rounded cells rather than elongated or striated cells along with ECM remodeling which includes reductions in total collagen (Riley et al 1994)

Diagnosis of tendinopathy includes taking patient history to determine if pain was present and for how long The characteristics of pain are also considered such as whether it is present only after activity during activity but not sufficient to interfere during activity lasting into the period after activity ceases or ultimately leading to total tendon failure A visual inspection can be made of the kinematics of the segments to identify any irregular aspects Assessment of the affected site may reveal swelling tenderness and nodularity or crepitus Other valid tools used are the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Questionnaire (VISA) for the patellar tendon

# Physio Knowledge - Key Points and Summary

# Key Points and Summary

# Tendinopathy Imaging Techniques

Imaging techniques allow for the quantification of tendinopathies typically using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine tendon anomalies Key points include:

- Linear ultrasound probes with frequency range of 75 to 15 MHz can spatially resolve superficial tissue to less than 01 mm
- Ultrasound imaging can describe three levels of tendinopathy:
- Normal tendon image
- Enlarged tendon area
- Hypoechoic area to tendon
- MRI provides high spatial and contrast resolution generating 3D images of tendon structures but is more expensive and operator-intensive than ultrasound

# Treatment of Tendinopathy

Treatment methods for tendinopathy include:

- Utilization of sclerosing agent (Polidocanol) to reduce localized vascularization with studies showing significant improvement in patients
- A case study of 35-year-old tennis player treated with Polidocanol injection and subsequent eccentric resistance loading resulted in no wrist pain after treatment

# Tendon Healing Process

Tendons have lower metabolic rate than skeletal muscle leading to slower healing process The healing phases include:

- Early phase: Inflammation with increased vascular permeability and removal of damaged material
- Secondary phase: Synthesis and remodeling characterized by type III collagen synthesis
- Final stage: Modeling phase where tissue refinement occurs transitioning from type III to type I collagen

Healing progresses through distinct stages with gradual reduction in tenocyte activity and vascularization leading to scar-like tendon tissue over approximately one year

# Key Points

- Tendons are highly adaptive structures capable of coping with varying demands
- The viscoelastic nature of tendons modifies muscle output potential and enables efficient energy storage and release
- The mechanisms by which tendons sense mechanical loading are not fully understood but may involve proteins connecting the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton

# Tendons - Physiotherapy Knowledge

# Tendons

Tendons are connected via stretch-sensitive ion channels to enable signaling events leading to collagen synthesis Injury to tendon can be categorized as acute or chronic Where acute injury occurs it is suggested that predisposing factors are present in many cases Overuse injuries can be described as chronic tendon injuries and fall into the description for tendinopathies

Clinical diagnosis of tendinopathies involves manual and visual elements Pain may or may not be present but changes to the tendon may include swelling crepitus tenderness and/or nodularity Imaging has been utilized to help diagnose tendinopathy; both ultrasound (US) and MRI are able to identify stages associated with tendinopathic changes such as enlargement of the tendon and hypoechogenic areas to the tendon

Treatments of acute and/or chronic tendon injuries are dependent on the site of injury activity levels or expectations of the patient the specific tendon injured and the grade of injury Many treatments involving pharmacological intervention are available; for example NSAIDs have been used with some degree of success to reduce swelling and symptoms of tendinopathy More recently sclerosing injections have been utilized with good results to reduce the neovascularization seen in some cases (described in an earlier ) It remains however that no one treatment is the best option where non-invasive conservative treatments are advocated

Where surgery is advocated there are again many different methodologies present to repair tendon This chapter has presented recent development whereby growth factors are encouraged within the repair by use of patch saturated with platelets Rehabilitation of the tendon following either acute or chronic injury involves period of rest or immobilization followed by gradual progressive development of strengthening and mobilizing exercises Recently eccentric exercise has been advocated as particularly useful adjunct to successful rehabilitation of tendon injuries; suggested mechanisms for this include high-frequency oscillation of force during loading (Rees et al 2008)

In conclusion tendon injury is complex multifaceted issue Injury can be cumulative or sudden and can appear suddenly without any precognition of problem Repair of tendon can take the of surgery which tends to have better outcome in terms of functionality and time taken to get back to pre-injury levels of activity or conservative which usually results in fewer complications such as infections There is currently no consensus on the best of treatment either repair or rehabilitation However there are number of recent developments that show promise

# Pathophysiology of Ligament Injuries

# Dror Steiner

# Chartered Osteopath

As ligament injuries are common both in athletes and the general public this chapter’s aim is to familiarize the reader with the anatomy physiology and pathology of ligamentous structure and function and then progress on to the healing process of ligamentous structures Later on this chapter will illustrate this process by introducing two of the most common ligamentous injuries and their available treatments

# Introduction

Ligaments of the skeletal system are dense connective tissues that attach bones across joint Ligaments play an important role in the neuro-muscular system by providing joints’ stability and sending sensory feedback to the central nervous system with information about stress tension joints’ motion stretch and pain (Riemann and Lephart 2002a)

# Anatomy

Fibroblasts are the cells that reside in ligaments producing both the matrix and the collagen fibre Fibroblasts are arranged in longitudinal rows parallel to the fibres and communicate with each other by gap junction mechanism that is poorly understood (Chi et al 2005)

The matrix is composed of proteoglycans and collagen fibres In ligaments the most common proteoglycan is decorin which strengthens the links between collagen fibres (Ilic et al 2005)

Ligaments are made up primarily of type I collagen with normally 1–2% elastic fibre (Frank 1996) During ligaments’ healing type III collagen levels increase and this is the reason for the weakening of ligaments at that point (Frank et al 1987) Ligaments such as ligamentum flavum and ligament nuchae have different structure with higher content of elastic fibre which allows recoil and saves muscular energy moving the spine back to the anatomical position from flexion (Yong-Hing and Reilly 1976)

Like other connective tissues ligaments have hierarchical structure

Each ligament is built by multiple fascicle units Each fascicle carries the collagen fibrils and fibroblast cells in longitudinal lines and encapsulates them in loose connective tissue called endoligament Fascicles are separate enough to allow shearing movements occurring at different joint positions (Frank 1996) The entire ligament is covered with vascular epiligament loose connective tissue that does not undergo much tension during the ligament’s tightness (Ian et al 2002)

The enthesis is the insertion of ligament to the nearby bone and has special arrangement This is where the collagen fibres fan out and are attached diagonally to bones via the periosteum This arrangement helps dissipate the ligament stress more evenly to the bone during different joint positions (Benjamin et al 2006)

Figure 6 Ligament structure

One character of the fascicle is the “crimps” – waviness of the fibrils The crimps give the ligaments its pseudo-elasticity and disappear once the ligament is stretched (Scott 2003)

Many ligaments are attached to the joint capsule tendons and other connective tissue and cannot be separated anatomically and functionally hence the common injuries where more than one tissue is damaged

# Blood Supply

The blood supply to ligaments deserves special examination as in most cases it is the limiting factor in healing injured ligaments Compared with other tissues ligaments are hypovascular and their blood supply is better closer to the bones’ attachments; the middle is poorly supplied (Bray et al 1996)

The blood supply to ligaments may arrive from three places:

- The epiligament carries blood along the ligament where blood vessels branch out to the endoligament and inside the fascicles A build-up of tension in the ligament will reduce the amount of blood circulating but will recover at rest (Bray et al 1996)
- The periosteal blood supply supplies mostly the enthesis region of the ligament
- The surrounding connective tissues such as fat joint capsule or muscles may carry some blood that collaterally supplies ligaments (Arnoczky 1985; Bray et al 1996)

Following injury the vascularity increases for about 40 weeks while the ligament’s fibres become disorganised The increased vascularity allows healing The final post-injury state is reduced vascularity (compared to the pre-injury level) with poor vessel organisation in the scar tissue Ligaments probably do not have the ability to keep the original vascular organisation causing reduced vascularity in the chronic healing stage which may be the cause of higher level of reinjuries

# Nerve Supply

Ligaments carry two types of sensory impulses to the central nervous system: mechanoreceptor and pain

# Composition

|Component|Percentage (dw)|Details|
|---|---|---|
|Collagen|60%|Type I (III IV V VI XII XIV)|
|Proteoglycan|05%|Including decorin versican lumican|
|Glycoproteins|5%|Including tenascin COMP elastin|

As above but also includes:

- Collagen type II IX XI
- Aggrecan biglycan

# Physiology of Ligaments

# Physiology

Mechanoreceptors signal mechanical events occurring in the tissue and have an important role in the coordinated motion pattern Ruffini receptors are the most common mechanoreceptors in ligaments and joint capsules whilst the others are Pacinian Golgi tendon organ-like and free nerve endings All of these receptors allow the central nervous system to assess the amount of stress joints undergo and execute patterns of muscle contraction to help protect joints from overstretching (Riemann and Lephart 2002b)

Following an injury both the peripheral and central nervous systems undergo modifications One study found that the post-injury instability of the anterior cruciate ligament is due in part to remodeling of the central nervous system The remodeling is probably due to the habitual reduction of usage of that area (Valeriani et al 1996) As ligaments become strained and torn the nerve supply loses certain amount of receptors This by itself can damage the peripheral nervous system and prevent it from accurately supplying the central nervous system with real-time sensation of what happened to the joint

In any case following an injury it is probably both the central and peripheral nervous systems that are damaged and thus supply corrupted sensory to the central nervous system This in turn corrupts the muscular contraction pattern (Riemann and Lephart 2002b) One author’s hypothesis is that some cases of back pain for example may originate from chronic ligamentous tension which sends corrupt sensory message to spinal muscles to contract continuously causing those muscles to be in chronic tension and fatigue (Panjabi 2007)

# Mechanical Properties of Ligaments

Ligaments have similar mechanical properties to other connective tissues: viscoelasticity and stress-strain (Norking and Levangie 2005)

The first mechanical property of ligament is its non-linear stress-strain relationship (see Figure 63) The stress-strain graph demonstrates three regions:

1 Toe region - this is where the deformity (ligament length) is high while the force applied is low Anatomically this is where the fibrils’ crimps slack begins to tighten The toe region is where most ligaments are at rest
2 Linear region - this is where stress build-up creates linear build-up of strain or stretch to the ligament This region demonstrates ligaments during normal joint’s movement
3 Failure region - this is where even mild increase in stress to the ligament creates large deformation as the ligament is overstretched or torn

# Pathophysiology of Ligament Injuries

# Viscoelastic Properties of Ligaments

Ligaments exhibit viscoelastic properties which means they can stretch and return slowly to their normal while dampening shearing forces There are three key viscoelastic behaviors:

- Creep: The tendency of ligament to slowly elongate under load and return to its original length once the load is removed
- Stress Relaxation: Under constant deformation the stress in the ligament will decrease over time
- Hysteresis: The energy lost in the process of loading and unloading ligament where the length after unloading is different from the length before loading

# Creep

Creep is illustrated in Figure 64 For example under load the ligament will slowly elongate and then return to its original length once the load is taken away The rate of creep increases at high temperatures

# Stress Relaxation

The second viscoelastic property is stress relaxation depicted in Figure 65 This means that under constant deformation the stress will decrease over time

# Hysteresis

Hysteresis is illustrated in Figure 66 It shows how loading ligament multiple times in short period can cause strain or tear if there is not enough recovery time between cycles

# Adaptation of Ligaments

Ligaments adapt to external and internal changes throughout life The effects of exercise and long-term immobility on ligaments are well-documented Collagen fibrils increase in thickness in response to exercise and decrease in thickness due to immobility (Kannus et al 1992)

There are no differences between pre-puberty male and female ligamentous structures However following puberty females exhibit increased joint laxity (Quatman et al 2008)

# Treatment and the Healing Process

# Treatment and the Healing Process

The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is equal between males and females but the post-puberty injury rate is at least three-fold higher in adolescent females (Agel et al 2005) The knee cruciate ligaments express sex hormone receptors for oestrogen testosterone and relaxin (Faryniarz et al 2006) There is an increased risk of ACL strain during the pre-ovulation stages of the menstrual cycle where hormone levels change from low to high (Slauterbeck et al 2002) Due to different individual hormonal profiles during the menstrual cycle there is significant difference in the amount of ligamentous laxity and risk of injury (Shultz et al 2006) In the elderly there is an increase in joint capsule and ligament laxity which may be one of the reasons for the increase in incidents of osteoarthritis (Rudolph et al 2007)

# Pathology

Pathological changes in ligaments may occur due to structural and functional failure Any strain to ligament may cause long-term joint instability There are agreed degrees of ligament strain: 1st degree is mild 2nd degree moderate and 3rd degree is complete tear (Chen et al 2008) Following strain ligaments do not heal by producing identical tissue; instead scar tissue is formed The scar tissue presents with an uneven matrix smaller diameter collagen fibers weaker collagen crosslinking and limited creep (Figure 67)

The blood circulation is also affected with long-term reduction in blood circulation to the scar tissue (Bray et al 1996) Although scar tissue is formed relatively fast there are still mechanical and chemical changes months and years after the injury though it never has normal appearance or function again resulting in high level of recurrences (Frank et al 1999) Ankle sprains for example reoccur in 73% of all athletes (Yeung et al 1994) As ligaments provide the proprioceptive sensory nerve supply to the central nervous system any ligament injury may cause further problems in the neuromuscular system

# Treatment and the Healing Process

Following strain injury the gap within the ligament fills with blood to start the inflammation phase Fibroblasts proliferate the ligaments revascularize and the gap becomes filled with scar tissue (Frank et al 1992) Fibroblasts start producing scar tissue made by type III collagen This collagen-type material creates rapid disorganized structure with weaker cross-links to fill the gap between the ligament’s edges quickly (Frank et al 1987) Followed is the long remodeling period which can take months or even years as the matrix and collagen fibers are rearranged to have stronger bonds

The healing process depends on several parameters: an isolated strain heals better than when it combines with other tissue injuries; the degree of the injury; certain ligaments heal better than others (such as the MCL compared with the ACL); and failure of the repair process can appear months post-injury (Frank et al 1992) The viewpoints of the main two treatments are immobility long rest and braces versus the sooner-than-later active treatment

A systematic review finds no data to support any benefits from using braces in sprained ligaments (Pietrosimone et al 2008) Another study found that early activity rather than long immobility would make the healing time

# Pathophysiology of Ligament Injuries

# Pathophysiology of Ligament Injuries

Immobility affects the ligament on cellular level with fibroblasts appearing uneven For grades I–II non-operative active treatment approach is the most common which usually comprises rest (for limited period) ice compression and elevation (RICE) isometric and isotonic exercises and proprioceptive training The rationale for using the RICE treatment is to reduce inflammation during the acute phase

Proprioceptive training focuses primarily on the lower limb particularly post-sprain in the ankle joint The idea is to maintain proprioceptive neural function by continuously using the joint in challenged position Research has shown that even unsupervised home proprioceptive exercises can reduce the rate of recurrence in athletes

Another treatment method is exercise which aims to improve the proprioceptive properties of the damaged ligament and strengthen the muscles surrounding the affected joint

# Examples of Ligament Injuries

# Lateral Ankle Sprain

The ankle joint is one of the most common sites of ligament injury with higher recurrence rate compared to other ligament strains It accounts for 06% of all cases in Accident and Emergency in the UK with higher rate of 13% in young girls Ankle sprains are the most common acute sports injury with recurrence rate of 59%

The most common ligamentous injury is to the lateral ankle particularly the anterior talofibular ligament which is the weakest ankle joint ligament and limits relatively large inversion at the subtalar joint Lateral ankle injury typically occurs due to excessive supination resulting from mechanical and/or functional instability

Increased risk factors for sprain injuries include:

- Previous sprains
- Wearing shoes with air cells
- Being overweight
- Not stretching before sports activities
- Increased foot width
- Weak active eversion and dorsiflexion

Immobilization of the sprained joint has been found to be less effective than active treatment The most common treatment for grade I and II during an acute sprained ankle is RICE Early exercise including dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range-of-motion exercises as well as isometric and isotonic strength-training exercises are recommended by many authors

Another treatment is balance and coordination training performed on wobble board which appears to halve the recurrence of sprained ankle ligament This exercise enhances the proprioceptive neural function of the central nervous system and reduces the response time of the peroneal and other muscles around the ankle joint to protect the ligaments from reinjury

A meta-analysis found that for grade III sprain ankle the possibility of surgical ligament reconstruction is controversial Research indicates that only late ligament reconstruction appears to be better than conservative treatment after all other treatment modalities fail to produce joint stability

# Anterior Cruciate Ligament Sprain

The ACL resists anterior tibial translation on the femur and rotational motion at the knee joint It can withstand multiple stresses and varying tensile strains simultaneously property not yet achieved with any ACL artificial reconstruction Non-contact ACL injuries can occur during deceleration and acceleration motions excessive quadriceps contraction and reduced hamstrings co-contraction particularly when the knee is internally rotated at or near full knee extension

ACL injuries are more common in contact sports with the highest rate observed in footballers The exact damage to the ligament will determine the length of the healing process

# Summary Key Points of Ligaments

- Ligaments offer joints stability with sensory feedback to the central nervous system
- Ligaments’ blood supply is the limiting factor in many healing processes of sprains
- Ligaments heal by the process of laying down scar tissue which exhibits structurally different tissue organization and is weaker compared to the original ligament
- Most frequent treatment for grade I–II sprains includes RICE early mobilization isometric and isotonic strengthening exercises neuromuscular rehabilitation and return to normal function as soon as possible For grade III injury reconstructive surgery is an option

# Introduction

Skeletal injuries are common in sport especially in contact sports such as football and rugby and in individual sports such as skiing and gymnastics This chapter provides an overview of the skeleton and its component parts Special attention is paid to the process of bone formation or ossification and its unique implications for healing following skeletal injuries The chapter further considers principles of rehabilitation in relation to skeletal injury and pathology The use of annotated diagrams and schema within the chapter further emphasise important processes in skeletal organisation (Figure 71)

# The Skeleton

The skeleton can be divided into two subgroups:

1 Axial skeleton – bones of the skull vertebral column ribs and sternum
2 Appendicular skeleton – bones of the upper and lower limbs

# Bone Composition and Function

Bone is living well-organised vascular of connective tissue It is largely composed of an organic protein collagen and an inorganic mineral hydroxyapatite which combine to provide mechanical and supportive role in the (Smith et al 1983) Bone is dynamic tissue that requires stress for normal development The capacity of bone to adapt its structure to imposed loads has become known as Wolff’s Law:

Wolff’s Law states that bone responds to the stresses that are imposed upon it by rearranging its initial architecture in the best way to withstand stress (Porter 2008)

# Functions of Bones

Bones function as:

- Protectors of vital organs – provides mechanical protection for most of the ’s internal organs thereby reducing the risk of injury to them
- Supportive structures – the skeleton is the framework of the and provides attachment for skeletal muscles
- Levers – the skeleton assists with movement
- Reservoirs for calcium and phosphorus – storage for minerals (calcium and phosphorus) which are released when needed into the blood
- Blood producing cells – develops red blood cells in the bone marrow

# Bone Structure

There are primarily three types of bone namely:

- Woven
- Compact
- Cancellous

# Woven Bone

Woven bone is normally remodelled and replaced with either compact or cancellous bone It is found during embryonic development during fracture healing (callus formation) and in some pathological states such as hyperparathyroidism and Paget Disease (Recker et al 1992)

# Compact Bone

Compact bone is the outer structure and provides mechanical strength while cancellous bone forms the inner structure and its function is the metabolic unit of the bone Compact bone is dense and surrounds the cancellous bone

The primary structural unit of compact bone is an osteon also known as Haversian system Osteons consist of cylindrical shaped lamellar bone that surrounds longitudinally oriented vascular channels called Haversian canals; horizontally oriented canals are known as Volkmann's canals

# Bone Formation and Growth

# BONE FORMATION AND GROWTH

# Bone Structure

Bone consists of various components including:

- Spongy Bone
- Compact Bone
- Yellow Marrow

Oriented vascular channels known as Volkmann canals connect adjacent osteons The periosteum dense irregular connective tissue covers the outer surface of all bones except in areas where articular cartilage is present It is divided into:

- Fibrous Layer: Contains fibroblasts
- Oseogenic Layer: Contains progenitor cells that develop into osteoblasts which are responsible for forming and repairing bones

The periosteum is sensitive to injury due to the presence of nociceptors and provides nourishment through its blood supply It is attached to bone by strong collagenous fibers known as Sharpey’s fibers which extend to the outer circumferential and interstitial lamellae Additionally it serves as an attachment point for muscles and tendons

Bone including the marrow periosteum metaphysis diaphysis and epiphysis is richly supplied with blood vessels Studies by Shim et al (1967) and Tothill and MacPherson (1986) reported that approximately 7% of the cardiac output is sent to the skeleton

# Classification of Bones

Bones are usually classified according to their shape The main categories of bones are summarized in the below:

**Table 71: Classification of Bones**
|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Long Bones|Longer than they are wide eg femur|
|Short Bones|Approximately equal in length and width eg carpals|
|Flat Bones|Thin and flat eg skull bones|
|Irregular Bones|Complex shapes eg vertebrae|
|Sesamoid Bones|Embedded within tendons eg patella|

# Cancellous Bone

Cancellous (spongy) bone consists of spicules of bone enclosing cavities containing marrow (blood-forming cells) This type of bone is strong but the spaces make it light and flexible Cancellous bone is always covered and therefore protected by compact bone In long bones cancellous bone is found in the epiphysis (at the end of the long bone); in some it also extends down inside into the shaft In all other bones it forms the central mass of bone within compact bone lining

In adults 80% of the skeleton is compact bone However the relative proportions of compact and cancellous bone vary in different parts of the skeleton For example in the lumbar spine cancellous bone accounts for about 70% of the total bone tissue whereas in the femoral neck and radial diaphysis it accounts for about 50% and 5% respectively (Kanis 1994; Einhorn 1996; Fleisch 1997)

# Bone Covering

The periosteum is membrane that lines the outer surface of all bones (Netter 1987) except in the area of joint where articular cartilage is present

# Bone Formation and Growth

Ossification is the name given to the formation of bone There are three cells involved in bone metabolism:

1 Osteoblasts: Bone forming cells of mesenchymal origin
2 Osteoclasts: Bone resorbing cells
3 Osteocytes: Cells of the matrix found in mature adult bone

Signaling pathways between these cells help regulate the balance between bone formation and bone resorption Osteoblasts originate from local mesenchymal stem cells (bone marrow stroma or connective tissue mesenchyme) These stem cells undergo proliferation and differentiate into preosteoblasts and then into mature osteoblasts (Triffitt 1996) The plasma membrane of osteoblasts is rich in alkaline phosphatase which enters the systemic circulation

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Injuries

Enzyme is used as biochemical marker of bone formation Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts embedded in the organic bone matrix which subsequently become mineralised They have numerous cell processes forming network of thin canaliculi that connects them with active osteoblasts and flat lining cells Osteocytes probably play role in the homeostasis of this extracellular fluid and in the local activation of bone formation and/or resorption in response to mechanical loads (Nijweide et al 1996)

Osteoclasts are giant cells containing 4–20 nuclei that reabsorb bone Osteoclastic reabsorption takes place at the cell/bone interface in sealed-off microenvironment (Baron 1996; Teitelbaum et al 1996) The mechanism of bone resorption involves the secretion of hydrogen ions and proteolytic enzymes into the sub-osteoclastic resorbing compartment The hydrogen ions dissolve the bone minerals thereby exposing the organic matrix to the proteolytic enzymes (Baron 1996; Teitelbaum et al 1996) These enzymes which include collagenases and cathepsins are responsible for the breakdown of the organic matrix

Bone metabolism is under constant regulation by host of hormonal and local factors Three of the calcitropic hormones that most affect bone metabolism are parathyroid hormone vitamin D and calcitonin

# Categorisation of Bones

|Type of Bone|Function|
|---|---|
|Long bones|This type of bone functions as lever They have greater length than width and consist of shaft and variable number of endings (extremities) They are usually somewhat curved for strength Examples include femur tibia fibula humerus ulna and radius|
|Flat bones|This type of bone has broad surface for muscle attachment and is used for the protection of underlying organs Examples include cranial bones (protecting the brain) the sternum and ribs (protecting the organs in the thorax) and the scapulae|
|Sesamoid bones|This type of bone develops in some tendons in locations where there is considerable friction tension and physical stress However their presence and quantity varies considerably from person to person Examples include patellae and under the 1st metatarsal|
|Irregular bones|This type of bone has complicated shapes and so cannot be classified into any of the above (shape-based) categories Their shapes are due to the functions they fulfill within the eg providing major mechanical support for the yet also protecting the spinal cord (in the case of the vertebrae) Examples include the vertebrae and some facial bones|
|Short bones|These types of bone are roughly cube-shaped and have approximately equal length and width Examples include ankle and wrist bones|

# Cartilage

Cartilage is non-vascular connective tissue that is divided according to its minute structure into:

- Hyaline cartilage (articular) – covers joint surfaces
- Fibrocartilage – knee meniscus vertebral discs
- Elastic cartilage – outer ear

These different forms of cartilage are distinguished by their structure elasticity and strength In general cartilage is tough fibrous and blood vessel-free connective tissue that forms flexible linkages supporting structures and acts as shock absorber in joints such as the knee Hyaline (articular) cartilage is the most common type of cartilage In addition to being found in articulated joints hyaline cartilage forms the majority of the skeleton of fetus Later in fetal development

# Hormones that Most Affect Bone Metabolism

|Hormone|Description|
|---|---|
|Parathyroid hormone|Produced via the parathyroid glands which are small endocrine glands in the neck Humans have four parathyroid glands which are usually located behind the thyroid gland Increases the flow of calcium into the calcium pool Maintains the ’s extracellular calcium pool level at relatively constant level Osteoblasts are the only cells that have parathyroid hormone receptors Parathyroid hormone has antagonistic effects to those of calcitonin|
|Vitamin D|Fat soluble molecule Stimulates intestinal and renal calcium binding proteins and facilitates active calcium transport Inhibits parathyroid hormone secretion|
|Calcitonin|Serves to inhibit calcium dependent cellular metabolic activity|
---
# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Injuries

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Injuries

Hyaline cartilage is replaced by bone The free surfaces of most hyaline cartilage (except that found in joints) are covered by layer of fibrous connective tissue known as perichondrium The perichondrium is rich in type of cell known as the fibroblast Compositionally hyaline cartilage is made of water (75% by weight) collagen (10% by weight mainly collagen type II) with the remainder being non-fibrous material such as chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate The collagen provides strength and makes hyaline cartilage resistant to compression Also the collagen provides means by which the cartilage can be anchored to bone

Cartilage is metabolically active tissue that under normal conditions is maintained in relatively slow state of turnover by sparse population of chondrocytes distributed throughout the tissue (Naujok et al 2008)

# Common Cartilage Injuries

It is well known that lesions which are confined to the hyaline cartilage alone have little or no capacity to heal (Naujoks et al 2008) In general the individual becomes symptomatic and significant progression to osteoarthritis is possible (Lohmander 2003)

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common of arthritis which is leading cause of physical disability increased healthcare usage and impaired quality of life (Felson 1990; Guccione et al 1994) The term OA also applies particularly to the degeneration and excessive wear of cartilage This condition develops and progresses with an increase in age Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that participation in certain competitive sports increases the risk for OA (Kujala et al 1994; Buckwalter and Lane 1997) Moderate regular running has low if any risk leading to OA (Lane et al 1993; Newton et al 1997) Sport activities that appear to increase the risk for OA include those that demand high-intensity acute direct joint impact as result of contact with other participants playing surfaces or equipment (Buckwalter and Lane 1997)

# Bone Fractures

Fractures are potentially serious injuries damaging not only the bone but also the soft tissue in the surrounding area Although the bone tissue itself contains no nociceptors bone fracture can be very painful due to:

- The breaking in the continuity of the periosteum;
- Oedema of nearby soft tissues caused by bleeding of torn periosteal blood vessels evoking pressure pain;
- Spasms in muscles trying to hold bone fragments in place

The severity of fracture depends on its location and the damage done to the bone and tissue near it Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue

# Clinical Features of Fracture

The features of fracture are many and varied depending on the cause and nature of the injury The clinical features are listed below:

- Pain
- Deformity
- Oedema
- Muscle spasm
- Abnormal movements
- Loss of function
- Shock
- Limitation of joint movement

# Common Skeletal Injuries and Their Manifestation

As previously stated bone provides structural support and protection facilitating movement and mineral storage Therefore injuries to bone can compromise any of these functions and interrupt daily functions

# Stress Fractures

Stress-related bone injuries have become commonplace amongst the members of our increasingly active society and account for up to 10% of cases in typical sport medicine practice (Jones et al 1989)

# Table 73: Types of Bone Fracture

|Type of Fracture|Description of Fracture|
|---|---|
|Compound (open)|Occurs when the sharp ends of the broken bone protrude through the individual’s skin|
|Closed|Skin remains intact|
|Depressed or fissured|Occurs when sharp localized blow depresses segment of cortical bone below the level of surrounding bone – example – fractured skull|
|Greenstick|Seen in children – fracture is on one side of the bone but does not tear the periosteum of the opposite side|
|Spiral|This is caused by opposite rotator forces pulling on the bone|
|Oblique|The fracture is oriented at an angle of greater or equal to 30 degrees to the axis of the bone|
|Transverse|The fracture is oriented at right angle to the axis of the bone|
|Avulsion|The fracture is caused by sudden muscle contraction with the muscle pulling off the portion of the bone|
|Comminuted|The fracture involves multiple fracture fragments|
|Stress|The fracture results from stresses repeated with excessive frequency to the bone|

Stress fractures occur in normal and abnormal bones that have been subjected to repeated traumas Other terms used to describe this injury include crack fracture pseudofracture spontaneous fracture and exhaustion fracture (Belkin 1980; Jones et al 1989) These fractures occur in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing bones There are two general types of stress fractures: insufficiency fracture and fatigue fracture

Insufficiency fracture results from normal stress applied to abnormal bone (Pentecost et al 1964) that is weakened by an underlying disorder such as osteoporosis rheumatoid arthritis osteomalacia or Paget’s disease (Stafford et al 1986)

Fatigue fractures occur when normal bones are subjected to increased loads and repetitive stresses None of these stresses is individually capable of producing fracture but combined they will lead to

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Injuries

# Pathophysiology of Skeletal Injuries

# Muscle Fatigue

Muscles provide shock absorption by taking the force away from the bone thereby protecting it from fracture As the muscle fatigues the stress is then transferred to the bone

Running is responsible for the greatest number of stress fractures (fatigue fractures) This occurs especially when an individual:

- Demonstrates poor training technique (changing intensity or duration)
- Has anatomic and biomechanical factors such as leg length discrepancy external rotation of the hip excessive pronation (Sullivan et al 1984; Giladi et al 1991)
- Uses poor footwear

# Mechanisms of Fatigue Fractures

Mechanical failure over time (Belkin 1980) It is not known or clear whether compressive gravitational or muscular forces are most responsible for fatigue fractures Several mechanisms have been proposed:

# Weight Bearing

- Weight bearing plays role in some stress fractures
- It is unlikely this mechanism is solely responsible for the development of stress fracture This is supported by the fact that stress fractures occur in both weight-bearing and non-weight bearing bones

# Muscle Actions

- Muscles may provide enough repetitive force to create stress fracture This is likely mechanism for upper limb stress fractures
- With training muscle strengthens quicker than bone causing mismatch that may lead to osseous fatigue failure (Daffner 1978)

# Osteoporosis

Osteopenia is not an injury but if left untreated can lead to the development of osteoporosis Osteopenia is when the Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is lower than normal but not low enough to be classed as osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is an established and well-defined disease that affects more than 75 million people in Europe Japan and the USA and causes more than 23 million fractures annually in Europe and the USA alone (WHO 2000) It is systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone density and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with consequent increase in bone fragility (WHO 2000)

Early osteoporosis is not usually diagnosed and remains asymptomatic; it does not become clinically evident until fractures occur Loss of bone density occurs with advancing age and rates of fracture increase markedly with age giving rise to significant morbidity and some mortality (WHO 1994)

Osteoporosis is three times more common in women than in men partly because women have lower peak bone mass and partly because of the hormonal changes that occur at menopause Just after menopause the rate of bone mass loss in females is up to 10 times faster than in men of the same age (Reginster et al 2006)

Estrogens have an important function in preserving bone mass during adulthood and bone loss
---
# Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis occurs as levels decline usually from about the age of 50 years Women live longer than men (the 1994 revision of the United Nations (1995) global population estimates and projections) and therefore have greater reductions in bone mass

According to the WHO diagnostic criteria women with bone density levels more than 25 standard deviations below the young adult reference mean are considered to have osteoporosis (Kanis et al 1994) Individuals with bone density below this threshold who also sustain fracture meet the definition of “established or severe osteoporosis” Among British women aged 50–59 years for example the prevalence of osteoporosis (as defined by WHO Study Group) at the femoral neck of the hip is 4% and at any site is 15% These figures rise to 48% and 70% respectively in women aged 80 years and over (WHO 2000)

One mode of athletic activity gymnastic training invokes high impact loading strains on bone which many have powerful osteogenic effects (Taaffe et al 1997) It has been reported that regional and total density in competitive collegiate gymnasts exceeds that of runners swimmers and non-athletic women regardless of menstrual cycle status (Myburgh et al 1993)

# The Female Athlete

The female triad is defined as serious syndrome (Micklesfield et al 2007) consisting of three interrelated components:

1 Disordered eating
2 Amenorrhea
3 Osteoporosis

The athletes most at risk are those participating in sports in which success is determined by thinness and aesthetics (Micklesfield et al 2007) The link between current and past menstrual dysfunction and potential deleterious effects on bone mineral density has been thoroughly investigated in female athletes (Drinkwater et al 1984; Marcus et al 1985; Micklesfield et al 1998; Miller et al 2006)

Results of treatments for reversing bone loss in athletes with menstrual dysfunction such as hormone replacement have shown equivocal outcomes (Gibson et al 1999) However the effectiveness of reduced training load (Warren et al 2003) and improved nutrition on the resumption of regular menses and the consequent increase in BMD suggests that energy balance is also implicated in the relationship between compromised bone health and menstrual dysfunction (Micklesfield et al 2007)

Extensive reports confirm that female athletes who present with menstrual dysfunction have lower BMD than amenorrhoeic athletes (Marcus et al 1985) Traditionally it has been accepted that the reason for the decrease in BMD that accompanies menstrual dysfunction is chronic hypo-oestrogenism (Micklesfield et al 2007) However the use of oral contraceptives and the restoration of regular menses in these athletes have not been successful in reversing this bone loss (Mazess et al 1991; Keen 1997; Micklesfield et al 1998)

Another mechanism may be responsible for the bone loss seen in athletes with menstrual dysfunction This is confirmed by Micklesfield et al (2007) in study that showed relationship between the occurrence of bone stress injuries and disordered eating patterns as well as high training load; this mechanism may be more related to energy balance than to hypo-oestrogenism

# Healing and Remodeling Process During Injury/Rehabilitation

Healthy bone remodeling occurs at many simultaneous sites throughout the where bone is experiencing growth mechanical stress microfractures or breaks About 20% of all bone tissue is replaced annually by the remodeling process The total process takes about 4–8 months and occurs continually throughout our lives The healing potential of bone is influenced by variety of biochemical biomechanical cellular hormonal and pathological mechanisms (Kalfas 2001)

The first stage of bone healing is referred to as the inflammatory phase (also known as the granulation stage fracture stage or clot phase) This stage has two parts: during the first part of this stage the surviving cells are sensitized to chemical messengers that are involved in the healing process This stage is completed within seven days The second part which lasts for about two weeks is the

# Healing Re-modelling Process During Injury/Rehabilitation

# Healing Re-modelling Process During Injury/Rehabilitation

The healing process during injury and rehabilitation can be divided into several stages:

# Stages of Bone Healing

The first stage involves the development of clot around the fracture site; this is not seen within stress fractures After the clot has formed granulation tissue forms within the space between the fracture fragments activating macrophages

The second stage is known as the reparative phase (callous stage) which can be divided into the soft callous and hard callous stages During the soft callous stage osteoblasts and chondrocytes within the granulation tissue begin to create cartilage and woven bone matrices This newly formed callus starts to mineralize after approximately week concluding with the formation of fracture/hard callus which is detectable on X-rays due to the calcium it contains The creation and mineralization of the callus can take 4–16 weeks to complete

The third stage is called the remodelling phase (consolidation phase) This process may occur over months to years and consists of restoring the fractured bone to its normal size shape and strength (Kalfas 2001) Adequate strength usually develops by six months

# Effects on the Bone Healing Process

# Nutrition

Calcium is the most abundant mineral found within the and contributes to the structure of teeth and bone (Thatcher et al 2009) It plays an important role in helping attain peak bone mass during bone development and preventing fractures in later life The daily recommended allowance of calcium intake is 800–1200 mg (Thatcher et al 2009) Multiple factors can affect the bioactivity of calcium:

- High-fat or high-fiber diets can interfere with or decrease the activity of calcium
- Large doses of zinc supplementation or mega doses of vitamin A can lower calcium bioactivity
- High protein diets can decrease calcium reserves by increasing urinary excretion of calcium (Placzek and Boyce 2006)

In addition alcohol consumption can decrease the absorption of calcium and various medications (heparin glucocorticoids) can affect calcium activity Vitamin D regulates calcium absorption and excretion especially when calcium intake is low

When calcium levels in the blood drop parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released PTH causes calcium to be released from the bones raising the low calcium levels in the blood Osteoporosis may result from chronically high levels of PTH (Groff and Gropper 2000)

# Wolff's Law and the Effect on Bone Healing

When mechanical stresses are applied to bone it has the ability to adapt by changing size shape and structure When optimal stress is placed on bone there is greater bone deposition than bone resorption resulting in increased bone density and hypertrophy of periosteal bone

# Effect of NSAIDs on Fracture Healing

Bone repair is complex process initiated by injury and an inflammatory response Prostaglandins mediate inflammation and influence the balance of bone formation and resorption which are essential for new bone formation NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenases which are essential for prostaglandin production (Dumont et al 2000) Long-term excessive use of these medications may reduce normal bone healing (Placzek and Boyce 2006)

# Conditions That Have Negative Effect

The following list provides range of conditions that negatively affect the bone healing process:

- Infection
- Poor reduction (poor realignment of fracture)
- Loss of local blood supply due to injury
- Vascular injury
- Failure to make callus (metabolic abnormalities)
- Formation of scar and fat tissue instead of callus

# Summary

Bone is dynamic fully functional organ of the human (Gormley and Hussey 2005) It has strong network of blood vessels and nerves; it constantly remodels itself; it can support extreme loads during exercise; and it can repair itself The presentation of optimal bone health should be priority of all health professionals (Gormley and Hussey 2005)

# Introduction

This chapter aims to introduce the structure and function of nerves and the neurological system and the pathophysiology of common nerve injuries The chapter also reviews some common nerve injuries their assessment and evidence-based treatment

# Anatomy of Nerves

The nervous system comprises the central autonomic and peripheral nervous systems (Gallant 1998) the latter of which consists of cranial nerves spinal nerves peripheral nerves and peripheral components of the autonomic nervous system (Gardner and Bunge 1984) The neurone is the structural unit of the nervous system and is responsible for conducting messages from one part of the to another (Marieb 1998)

The basic unit of the neurone is the axon more commonly known as the nerve fibre (Butler 1991) Axons can be either myelinated or non-myelinated Myelinated axons are surrounded by myelin sheath and have one Schwann cell per axon The Schwann cell is frequently interrupted by nodes of Ranvier structure that allows impulses to be conducted from one node to the next (Topp and Boyd 2006; Campbell 2008) Non-myelinated fibres however have several axons associated with only one Schwann cell (Topp and Boyd 2006; Campbell 2008)

Individual myelinated fibres and groups of non-myelinated fibres are surrounded by three connective tissue layers: the endoneurium the perineurium and the epineurium (Topp and Boyd 2006; Campbell 2008)

The innermost connective tissue layer is the endoneurium which is composed of longitudinally aligned collagen fibres and therefore plays an important role in protecting the axon from tensile forces (Butler 1991) Encompassing the endoneurial components axon and Schwann cells is the perineurium the second layer of connective tissue whose primary responsibility is to act as primary barrier to external forces (Lundborg 1988) Collectively all the contents surrounded by the perineurium what is known as nerve fascicle (Topp and Boyd 2006)

Collections of nerve fascicles then nerve which is surrounded by the outermost layer of connective tissue the epineurium (Campbell 2008) The epineurium is regarded as the most resistant connective layer to tensile forces (Sunderland 1978) as it surrounds protects and cushions the nerve fascicles (Butler 1991) Collectively all three connective tissue layers not only protect the axon but are also structurally developed to cope with the tensile stresses and compressive forces nerves typically have to endure (Butler 1991)

In everyday movements and postures nerves are subjected to various mechanical stresses (Topp and Boyd 2006) which can elongate compress or increase strain within the nerve (Shacklock 1995)

# Peripheral Nerve Injuries

# Peripheral Nerve Injuries

The ability of the nervous system to withstand and adapt to the mechanical stresses placed on it is essential to prevent injury (Shacklock 1995) Alterations in the physical stress to which biological tissue is subjected cause predictable responses within the tissue according to Mueller and Maluf’s (2002) Physical Stress Theory Injury to tissues is caused by excessive physical stress via any of the following mechanisms:

1 High magnitude stress applied to the tissue for brief duration; spinal cord injury is typical outcome from this mechanism of injury
2 Low magnitude stress applied for long duration or repetitively; an example of nerve injury from this particular mechanism of injury is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome at the wrist
3 Moderate stress applied to tissue many times Cubital Tunnel Syndrome at the elbow for example in javelin thrower whereby repetitive high load forces are exerted through the elbow and consequently the ulnar nerve is an example (Mueller and Maluf 2002)

Biological tissues such as nerves have an ideal physical stress range that they can tolerate to maintain homeostasis This is called the “maintenance stress range” (Mueller and Maluf 2002) Stress levels lower than the maintenance range decrease tissue’s tolerance to physical stress; for example during immobilization of limb muscle atrophy is typical bi-product of being in cast for prolonged period of time Contrastingly when physical stresses are exceedingly higher than the homeostatic stress range the associated tissues are unable to tolerate these and any subsequent stresses and ultimately become injured (Mueller and Maluf 2002)

The mechanical stresses nerve is subjected to are not the only factor which must be taken into account with nerve injury as the nature of the surrounding structures nerve traverses or passes through must also be considered (Butler 1991) The nervous system is surrounded by and comes into contact with many different anatomical structures which may be firm and unyielding such as the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the humerus or soft such as the tibial nerve in the posterior thigh musculature (Butler 1991) Additionally anatomically narrow passages through which the nerve must pass may also predispose individual nerves to entrapment neuropathies such as the ulnar nerve in the cubital fossa of the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006)

The extent of an injury to nerve is dependent on the mechanism of injury as traumatic injuries such as gun-shot wound (ie high magnitude stress) will significantly damage nerve’s integrity whilst low magnitude stress such as prolonged intermittent compression over long duration of time will have less of an impact on the nerve Nerve injuries were initially classified by Seddon (1943) based on the severity of the injury and the potential for reversibility of the condition (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006)

# Classification of Nerve Injury

Neurapraxia axonotmesis and neurotmesis are the three categories of nerve injuries classified by Seddon (1943) each describing different degrees of injury to the nerve’s anatomical structures (Table 81) Neurapraxia is the most benign injury and typically results from compression and/or traction (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006)

**Table 81: Classification of Nerve Injuries**
|Type of Injury|Description|
|---|---|
|Neurapraxia|Temporary loss of function due to compression or traction|
|Axonotmesis|Damage to the axon with preservation of the surrounding connective tissue|
|Neurotmesis|Complete disruption of the nerve including the axon and surrounding connective tissue|

# Table 1: Classification and Characteristics of Nerve Injury

|Classification|Anatomical Presentation|Clinical Presentation|Prognosis|
|---|---|---|---|
|Neuropraxia|Segmental demylenation|Slight motor loss Minimal sensory involvement|Excellent Up to 12 week recovery|
|Axontmesis|Loss of axonal continuity Connective tissue intact|Substantial loss of motor sensory and autonomic function|Good Surgery may be required|
|Neurotmesis|Complete disruption of nerve fibre and connective tissues|Significant muscle fibre atrophy Sensory loss|Poor Surgery is necessity|

Adapted from Seddon (1943)

Neuropraxia is characterized by intact nerve fibers that are temporarily unable to transmit signals due to injury to the myelin around the nodes of Ranvier The clinical presentation includes motor loss with minimal sensory involvement and little disturbance of sympathetic innervation Recovery typically occurs within 12 weeks and the prognosis is excellent

Axontmesis involves loss of continuity of the axon and myelin sheath while maintaining the majority of the connective tissue structure This results in significant loss of motor sensory and autonomic function distal to the injury site Neural regeneration occurs at rate of approximately 1mm per day and the prognosis for recovery is good

Neurotmesis is the most severe of peripheral nerve injury involving complete disruption of the nerve trunk and connective tissue The prognosis for recovery is poor and surgical intervention is often required Typical examples include avulsion of the nerve due to stab wounds or gunshot injuries

The majority of nerve injuries in sports typically involve neuropraxia or axontmesis leading to generally good prognosis for recovery

# Assessment of Nerve Injury

Neural and non-neural tissues should be assessed by the clinician in all patients presenting with pain through comprehensive subjective and physical examination Physical examination findings should complement the information obtained from the patient via subjective examination

Numerous clinical features may be evident in the assessment of patients presenting with peripheral neuropathic pain such as complaints of tingling burning and paresthesia along with antalgic postures and movement impairments Motor or sensory losses may also be evident

When nerve injury is suspected assessing the integrity of the nerve is vital Evaluation of the function of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve should be conducted via manual resistance testing to determine motor function Likewise sensory function should be assessed through touch in the areas of innervation

# Neurodynamic Testing

Nerves slide and stretch during limb movements to allow for changes in nerve bed length While healthy nerves can tolerate strain and compression injured or inflamed nerves become sensitive to mechanical stimuli and can inflict pain on movement

Neurodynamic tests were developed to evaluate peripheral nerve sensitivity to movement and to infer underlying pathomechanics To determine if neural tissues contribute to the patient’s symptoms it is important to move the neural structure in the area in question without moving the musculoskeletal tissues in the same region This is attempted by structural differentiation during neurodynamic tests

The concept behind structural differentiation is to move joint remote to the area where the patient experiences symptoms; should this decrease or increase symptoms neural involvement into patient symptoms should be suspected For example in patient presenting with posterior thigh pain moving the head from cervical flexion to extension during the slump test should have no effect on patient symptoms if the pain is of non-neural origin However should the clinician suspect the sciatic nerve is contributing factor to patient symptoms moving the cervical spine from flexion to extension should decrease the pain and/or permit further range of movement at the knee joint

Neurodynamic tests for the upper and lower extremities have been developed; each one is intended to identify whether specific nerve is contributing to the symptomatic patient

Resistance is experienced by the clinician (Shacklock 1995; Nee and Butler 2006) or to the point where the patient reports onset of pain or sub-maximal pain (Coppieters et al 2002) Three tests for the upper limb are described below each focused on examining the integrity of the three primary nerves in the upper extremity: the median radial and ulnar nerves For the lower limb the slump test and straight leg raise tests will be illustrated In-depth and more detailed clinical neurodynamic tests have been presented by Shacklock (2005)

# Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test with Median Nerve Bias

In patients presenting with suspected median nerve pathology whereby symptoms may be localized to the median nerve such as carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator tunnel syndrome incorporating neurodynamic test into the physical examination is essential to determine if the nerve contributes to patient symptoms To conduct this test the patient lies supine on the plinth with arms relaxed by the side of the

# Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test with Median Nerve Bias

Keeping the head in neutral position the clinician places hand over the superior aspect of the shoulder with the aim of depressing the shoulder as the test commences The clinician then holds the patient’s ipsilateral hand and places the glenohumeral joint in 90° abduction and 90° lateral rotation the forearm in full supination and the wrist in extension The clinician then supports the patient’s arm on their thigh with the aim of preventing adduction of the shoulder during the test Once in this position the clinician slowly extends the elbow to either onset of resistance or pain

To structurally differentiate the clinician can either ask the patient to execute contralateral side flexion of the head for distal symptoms or the wrist can be moved from extension into flexion for proximal symptoms (Shacklock 2005)

# Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test with Radial Nerve Bias

In patients presenting with radial neuropathy such as radial tunnel syndrome the clinician requires physical test which can be conducted to determine the sensitivity of the nerve to stretch To do this clinical test was developed to focus specifically on the radial nerve and is conducted as follows: the patient lies supine with arms resting by the side of the but in diagonal direction across the plinth This allows the clinician to apply shoulder depression using the anterior aspect of their hip whilst conducting the test

The patient’s starting position involves placing the elbow at 90° and the wrist and fingers in neutral The clinician then applies shoulder depression before moving the elbow into extension and the wrist and fingers into flexion whilst internally rotating the glenohumeral joint Finally glenohumeral abduction is applied and again the clinician ceases the movement at the point of resistance or pain

To structurally differentiate shoulder depression can be removed for distal symptoms whilst moving the wrist from flexion to neutral may identify proximal lesions (Shacklock 2005)

# Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test with Ulnar Nerve Bias

When symptoms are evident in the anatomical pathway of the ulnar nerve or the lower trunk of the brachial nerve (Shacklock 2005) neurodynamic testing specific to this nerve is important The testing sequence for an upper limb neurodynamic test with ulnar nerve bias requires the patient to lie supine on the plinth with the head in neutral position and the arms relaxed by the side of the 

The clinician prepares for depression of the shoulder as for the median nerve test The patient’s shoulder joint is abducted slightly whilst the elbow is maintained in extension and the forearm slightly pronated The wrist and hand of the patient remain in neutral position following which the clinician then commences the test by depressing the shoulder before applying extension to the wrist and fingers and pronation to the forearm The elbow is then brought

# Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test with Ulnar Nerve Bias

The clinician uses leg to support the moving limb making the movement more fluid Once resistance or pain is experienced by the clinician or patient respectively shoulder abduction ceases and the structural differentiation maneuver is applied; either contralateral cervical side flexion for distal symptoms or radial deviation for proximal symptoms (Shacklock 2005)

# Lower Limb Neurodynamic Test: The Slump Test

The slump test is used to evaluate the dynamics of the central and peripheral nervous systems from the head along the spinal cord and sciatic nerve tract and its extensions in the foot (Shacklock 2005) The slump test should be component of the clinical examination in patients who present with spinal symptoms (Butler 1991) and/or spinal pelvic and lower limb conditions whereby pain is experienced in the neural distribution of the sciatic nerve and its extensions (Butler 1991; Shacklock 2005)

To conduct the slump test the patient is requested to side on the plinth with the back of the knees to the edge of the plinth and to “sag” the upper or bring their shoulder towards their hips resulting in thoracic flexion The clinician then applies overpressure at the C7 spinous process with the medial aspect of the forearm (Figure 87) The patient is instructed to bring their chin to chest following which the clinician applies dorsiflexion to the ankle before slowly extending the knee to the point of resistance or pain To structurally differentiate the release of cervical flexion and ankle dorsiflexion are used for distal and proximal lesions respectively

# Lower Limb Neurodynamic Test: The Straight Leg Raise

The straight leg raise (SLR) is similar neurodynamic test to the slump test intended to evaluate the integrity of the lumbosacral trunk and plexus sciatic nerve and its expansion in the leg and foot (Shacklock 2005) The format for the SLR is as follows: the patient lies supine on the plinth with arms resting by the side of the The clinician uses one hand to support the posterior calf just proximal to the ankle joint; whilst the other hand is placed on the anterior aspect of the knee joint to ensure knee extension is maintained throughout

Maintaining this position the clinician then begins to lift the leg off the bed thereby conducting hip flexion moving to the point of resistance or patient pain Following this the clinician then applies dorsiflexion to the ankle by way of structurally differentiating (Figure 88) An increase in symptoms at this point indicates neural involvement in the patient’s condition To ascertain whether the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve is sensitive to stretch whilst conducting the SLR the clinician can plantarflex and invert the ankle while moving the ankle into dorsiflexion and eversion emphasizes the tibial nerve (Shacklock 2005)

# Neurodynamic Tests as Treatment Tools

A positive neurodynamic test is constituted by reproduction or increase in symptoms during the test which is subsequently decreased with the removal of the structural differentiating manoeuvre (Maitland 1985); difference in responses between limbs (Nee and Butler 2006); differences in available range of motion (Coppieters et al 2002; Nee and Butler 2006); or where there is structural differentiation supporting neurogenic source (Butler 2000)

Whilst all the aforementioned tests have been described from diagnostic point of view each of these can be modified and incorporated into treatment plans should their inclusion as treatment modality be warranted Modified versions of the neurodynamic tests can be used in clinical practice in the treatment plan for peripheral nerve injuries and can be specific to each patient The purpose of utilising neurodynamic tests as treatment tools is to minimise scarring and stretching of the nerve and maintain or restore normal nerve excursion and function (Wehbé and Schlegel 2004)

# Neural Treatment Techniques

Two neural treatment techniques will be considered in this chapter: sliding and tensioning techniques the principle of which can be applied to any neurodynamic test and considered for use in the treatment plan for neuropathy patients A “sliding” technique was defined by Coppieters et al (2009) as combination of movements that elongate the nerve bed at one joint whilst simultaneously reducing nerve bed length at an adjacent joint

# Treatment Plans for Nerve Injury

The sliding technique causes more longitudinal excursion of nerve than the tensioning technique (Coppieters et al 2009) and therefore from clinical viewpoint may be more suitable for highly irritable or acute neural conditions as it still encourages movement of the inflamed nerve whilst limiting the strain placed on the nerve A tensioning technique however is proposed to induce higher tension within the nerve and therefore less excursion (Coppieters et al 2009) than sliding technique and can therefore be considered more aggressive and possibly suitable for less irritable conditions The clinician should therefore consider the implementation of sliding or tensioning techniques into treatment plan for the patient presenting with neural symptoms with the former to be used in acute irritable conditions and the latter technique for use in the end stage of rehabilitation

Ultimately neurodynamic tests can be modified and used in the treatment plan for the neuropathic patient and can also be incorporated into home exercise programme (Kostopoulos 2004) Typical patient responses to neurodynamic tests as both diagnostic and treatment tool of which the patient should be aware range from reporting feelings of “stretching” tissue tension light numbness or slight increase of pain during the technique; all which should reduce or dissipate on cessation of the test or treatment (Kostopoulos 2004)

# Treatment Plans for Nerve Injury

Immediately post-injury inflammation occurs thereby rendering injured tissues less capable of tolerating stress compared to their pre-morbid level (Mueller and Maluf 2002) Nerve fibres become sensitive to stretch and low intensity pressure following injury (Dilley et al 2005) Therefore the importance of protecting the tissues during this acute inflammation stage from subsequent stress cannot be underestimated (Mueller and Maluf 2002) Conservative treatment is the initial recommended strategy in numerous neuropathies not requiring urgent medical attention Within this category of treatment several authors suggest incorporating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ice rest elimination of the aggravating activity physical and manual therapy into the conservative treatment plan (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009); the primary aim of which is to decrease inflammation and restore nerve function Brief treatment options will be provided in this following the discussion of each specific injury

# Peripheral Nerve Injury

Neurological conditions are common in athletes (Dimberg and Burns 2005) often dependent on the nature and intensity of the sporting activity (Toth 2009) A clinician may be confronted with signs and symptoms of neurological injuries affecting various aspects of the nervous system such as spinal nerve roots peripheral nerve injuries or plexopathies Possessing the ability to recognise and diagnose injuries specific to sporting activities and then subsequently to treat the injury is vital to clinician in sport (Toth 2009) to ensure rapid return to play for the athlete

The upper extremity is particularly vulnerable to nerve injury (Dahlin 2008) due to its high mobility (Aldridge et al 2001) and it is therefore unsurprising that the brachial plexus is the most commonly injured plexus in the (Wilbourn 2007) The brachial plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5 to T1 which enter the posterior cervical triangle between the scalene anterior and medius muscles (Pratt 2005) Superior middle and inferior nerve trunks of the brachial plexus are then formed by the C5–C6 C7 and C8–T1 nerve roots respectively (Reid and Trent 2002; Pratt 2005) These trunks divide into anterior and posterior portions behind the clavicle whereby these divisions then unite to lateral medial and posterior cords which enter the axilla (Reid and Trent 2002) The end result of the brachial plexus is the formation of peripheral nerves which supply the upper limb (Pratt 2005)

The primary peripheral nerves which are subsequently discussed in this chapter are the axillary nerve long thoracic nerve suprascapular nerve ulnar nerve median nerve and radial nerve; the anatomical locations of which can be viewed in Figure 812

# Brachial Plexus Neuropathy

# Stinger Syndrome

One of the most common brachial plexus neuropathies is Stinger Syndrome (Hershman 1990) which is more common in young adults who participate in sport (Unlu et al 2007) and particularly in contact sports

# Brachial Plexus

The superior trunk of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6) is thought to be the structure injured in this syndrome (Aldridge et al 2001; Dimberg and Burns 2005; Wilbourn 2007) Tensile overload is one mechanism of injury for the brachial plexus (Hershman 1990) whereby the head and shoulder of the symptomatic side have been forced in opposite directions to each other (Weinstein 1998; Dimberg and Burns 2005) thereby causing stretch and traction of the nerve Alternatively another mechanism of injury in Stinger Syndrome is where compressive force forces the head and neck into the posterolateral corner causing nerve root compression and thereby injuring the nerve (Weinstein 1998) Finally injury to the brachial plexus can occur as the result of direct blow to the area

# Stinger Syndrome

Symptoms reported for Stinger Syndrome generally involve single upper extremity (Dimberg and Burns 2005; Wilbourn 2007) with sharp burning pain and numbness accompanied by short-lived weakness down the arm (Weinstein 1998; Aldridge et al 2001) Patients who report bilateral or lower extremity symptoms should be treated with caution as spinal cord injury is potential injury (Dimberg and Burns 2005) An important finding with Stinger Syndrome is that symptoms are unilateral (Wilbourn 2007) and short-lived Neuropraxia and axontmesis are typically associated with this type of injury

If the symptoms resolve within minutes and there is no evidence of reduced strength or disrupted movement of the neck the athlete can be considered for return to play in the same competition (Dimberg and Burns 2005) However the player should be continuously monitored during the remainder of the competition and re-assessed over the subsequent weeks Cervical spine rehabilitation should be undertaken in the Stinger Syndrome patient aiming to protect the injured structures and control pain and inflammation in the initial stages following which flexibility and strength imbalances and deficits should be addressed (Weinstein 1998) Postural abnormalities should also be considered over the course of treating patients with cervical spine and nerve injuries

A treatment strategy for Stinger Syndrome can include NSAIDs modification of activity neurodynamic sliding techniques in the acute stage manual therapy of the cervical spine range of movement activities for the shoulder and strengthening of the shoulder and neck muscles

# Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

The thoracic outlet region in the upper extremity contains three structures: the subclavian artery subclavian vein and the brachial plexus all of which pass under the clavicle and subclavius muscle before then travelling beneath the pectoralis minor muscle close to its insertion point at the coracoid process whereafter the structures enter the axilla space (Atasoy 2004) These neurovascular structures pass through the interscalene triangle comprising of the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib whilst en-route to the axilla (Brantigan and Roos 2004) and are considered vulnerable to compression within this area Restriction of space for the neurovascular structures to pass through within the thoracic outlet can cause compression of the neural and/or vascular structures subsequently resulting in symptoms (Crosby and Wehbé 2004) Compression of one or more of the structures can lead to the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)

The clinical presentation of TOS can be variable presenting as either neurological or vascular condition or both However with Brantigan and Roos (2004) reporting 98% of cases to be neurological in origin and Crosby and Wehbé (2004) agreeing that the majority of patients have neurogenic symptoms for the purpose of this TOS will be discussed in relation to the brachial plexus only

TOS can develop insidiously or as consequence of previous traumatic injury such as whiplash or similar such trauma which ultimately causes chronic muscle spasm within the neck or shoulder (Brantigan and Roos 2004) Whilst the initial injury may be considered to be relatively minor the resultant effect of the injury on the brachial plexus may be delayed and the condition may take considerable time to develop The patient may complain of arm elevation exacerbating symptoms such as shoulder press or serving in tennis whilst exercise can induce similar response but only following cessation of the exercise rather than during it (Brantigan and Roos 2004) Neck stiffness may also be evident in patients with suspected TOS and therefore the physical examination should include comprehensive assessment of the neck shoulder and the upper extremity

Typically evident in patients with neurogenic TOS is the reproduction of symptoms when the clinician places mild to moderate pressure over the brachial plexus in the supraclavicular fossa of the symptomatic side (Brantigan and Roos 2004) Brantigan and Roos (2004) recommend incorporating the EAST (elevated arm stress test) into the clinical examination to diagnose TOS as few individuals with this condition are actually able to complete the test

In the majority of cases conservative treatment will alleviate symptoms and address the cause of TOS unless there is significant neural loss or vascular compression (Crosby and Wehbé 2004) Incorporation of NSAIDs postural control including during sleep manual therapy such as thoracic and first rib mobilisation and muscle and nerve gliding exercises into the treatment plan should be undertaken for patients with TOS (Crosby and Wehbé 2004)

# Peripheral Nerve Injuries

# Axillary Nerve

The axillary nerve is the terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus receiving its contributions from C5 and C6 nerve roots (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) Axillary nerve injury is well-known complication of anterior glenohumeral dislocation (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) evident in 9–18% of this injury (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) The close proximity of the anatomical course of the axillary nerve to the shoulder joint increases its susceptibility to injury secondary to shoulder dislocation The nerve travels inferior to the humeral head before passing through the quadrangular space where it then wraps horizontally around the posterior aspect of the surgical neck of the humerus (Pratt 2005) It then enters the deltoid muscle which it innervates along with teres minor (Goslin and Krivickas 1999)

Glenohumeral dislocation typically occurs in an inferior-anterior direction (Owens and Itamura 2000) whereby on dislocation the humeral head moves into the infra-articular fossa (Pratt 2005) As consequence of the forced abrupt movement of the humeral head traction force is placed on the axillary nerve (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) resulting in stretching of the nerve around the humeral head and tension propagating to the infra-clavicular brachial plexus (Pratt 2005); the overall outcome resulting in nerve injury (Pratt 2005) Blunt trauma to the anterior/lateral aspect of the shoulder typically seen in tackling during rugby whereby compressive force is applied to the axillary nerve is another common mechanism of injury for this structure (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998)

Injury to the axillary nerve with shoulder dislocations may go unnoticed initially as the bony injury may dominate the clinical picture (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) and consequently for an athlete participating in contact sports thorough neurological examination with shoulder dislocation should be undertaken (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) A well-defined patch of sensory loss over the lateral shoulder in addition to weakness in shoulder abduction (deltoid) and external rotation (teres minor) are typical clinical reporting for axillary neuropathy (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) Neurological complications following shoulder dislocation of the brachial plexus and axillary nerve are enhanced in patients greater than 50 years or if the shoulder remains dislocated for greater than 12 hours (Pratt 2005)

Restoring full range of motion at the shoulder is priority in the conservative treatment for the axillary nerve (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) NSAIDs and analgesics will assist with pain and inflammation control during the acute stage Strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff and periscapular muscles should also be undertaken (Aldridge et al 2001) in addition to nerve gliding exercises

# Long Thoracic Nerve

The long thoracic nerve arises from the ventral rami of C5–C7 spinal nerves (Goslin and Krivickas 1999) and innervates exclusively the serratus anterior muscle (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Aldridge et al 2001; Pratt 2005) The relative immobility of the long thoracic nerve is primary factor in the occurrence of injury to this structure as it is anchored at regular short intervals throughout its anatomical course (Pratt 2005) particularly at the scalene medius and serratus anterior muscles (Goslin and Krivickas 1999) Consequently traction or stretch of the long thoracic nerve such as with extreme excursion of the shoulder girdle is common mechanism of injury for this structure (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005)

Palsy of this nerve has been associated with repetitive motion or muscular hypertrophy in sport (Toth et al 2005) One case reported an elite marksman presenting with long thoracic neuropathy due according to the author to the positional stress imposed during repetitive shooting postures whilst holding the gun (Woodhead 1985) Maintaining static postures that keep the shoulder girdle elevated for long periods is an alternate way in which injury to the long thoracic nerve occurs (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005) This is evident in patients with Saturday night palsy (Pratt 2005) which originates from patients falling asleep on chair with the shoulder draped over the back of chair thereby

The long thoracic nerve is susceptible to injury due to prolonged stretching and external compression (Pratt 2005) Scapula winging is the most prevalent clinical finding associated with this injury (Aldridge et al 2001; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) resulting from weakness of the serratus anterior muscle (Owens and Itamura 2002)

This clinical finding is best demonstrated by having the patient perform push-up against wall (Owens and Itamura 2002) Early symptoms include an ache or burning pain in the posterior shoulder associated weakness in arm elevation and abduction and difficulty performing overhead activities (Aldridge et al 2001; Owens and Itamura 2002)

Treatment strategies for long thoracic neuropathy include:

- Rest and avoidance or modification of aggravating activities (Goslin and Krivickas 1999)
- NSAIDs and physical therapy
- Exercises to stabilize the scapula against the thorax
- Maintaining shoulder range of motion (Aldridge et al 2001)
- Increasing strength of trapezius and rhomboids (Goslin and Krivickas 1999)

# Suprascapular Nerve Injury

The suprascapular nerve originates from the superior nerve trunk (C5–C6 nerve roots) at Erbs’ point (Aldridge et al 2001; Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and innervates the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles responsible for shoulder abduction and lateral rotation respectively (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005)

This nerve is vulnerable to entrapment as it passes through the suprascapular foramen and curves around the spinoglenoid notch (Pratt 2005) Injury can occur due to acute stretching blow to the shoulder or insidious onset (Owens and Itamura 2001; Aldridge et al 2001)

Management for suprascapular nerve injury should involve:

- Modifying or ceasing aggravating activities (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Aldridge et al 2001)
- Incorporating NSAIDs and scapular stabilization exercises into the rehabilitation program (Aldridge et al 2001)
- Restoring full range of motion at the shoulder
- Increasing strength of scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff muscles (Goslin and Krivickas 1999)

# Ulnar Nerve Injury

The ulnar nerve is the endpoint of the medial cord of the brachial plexus composed of fibers from C8 and T1 nerve roots (Rokito et al 1996; Aldridge et al 2001; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) It is highly mobile at the elbow joint making it susceptible to direct trauma compression and traction (Izzi et al 2001)

# Cubital Tunnel Syndrome

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common neuropathy in the upper extremity (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and the most common entrapment neuropathy at the elbow (Salama and Stanley 2008) responsible for ulnar nerve entrapment

# Cubital Tunnel Syndrome

The cubital tunnel syndrome is prevalent in throwing athletes due to the anatomical arrangement of the elbow The arcuate ligament and medial collateral ligament of the elbow the roof and floor of the tunnel During elbow flexion the attachments for the structures of the cubital tunnel are pulled apart tightening both the floor and roof of the tunnel Additionally during forearm flexion the trochlea of the humerus rotates under the medial collateral ligament elevating the floor of the tunnel and decreasing space for the ulnar nerve to glide and move This condition is common among athletes who perform repetitive elbow joint movements particularly those involving forced extension such as pitching baseball

During high-velocity throwing athletes with excessive laxity at the elbow experience increased traction on the nerve leading to higher susceptibility to ulnar neuropathy Clinically patients may present with diminished sensation in the ulnar aspect of the fourth finger and all of the fifth finger along with elbow pain radiating to the hand especially at night when the elbow is flexed for prolonged periods during sleep Weakness in finger abductors and thumb adductors as well as difficulty maintaining powerful grip may also be reported

In overhead athletes pain along the medial joint line may be the first sign of ulnar neuropathy and complaints of popping or snapping sensation at the elbow during flexion and extension may indicate subluxation of the ulnar nerve

In the early stages of nerve compression provocative testing may be the only positive finding A positive Tinel’s sign should be performed at the entrapment site and along the nerve's course where reproduction of symptoms in the relevant neural distribution constitutes positive test Tapping the ulnar nerve behind the medial epicondyle is Tinel’s test for the ulnar nerve at the elbow Positional and provocation tests should also be conducted with each test held for one minute and deemed positive if there is an alteration in sensations in the correct neural distribution

It is crucial to differentially diagnose the possibility of thoracic outlet syndrome lower cervical neuropathy or compressive ulnar neuropathy at the wrist Conditions such as medial epicondylitis medial ligament laxity and ulnar neuritis also require differential diagnosis

Conservative treatment may include avoiding aggravating activities using NSAIDs altering throwing techniques manual therapy nerve gliding and exercise therapy such as progressive strengthening program A night splint may be indicated in early cases especially if the patient sleeps prone with the elbow tucked under pillow which can place local pressure on the ulnar nerve Night splints should only be used if the patient experiences symptoms while sleeping

# Treatment Plans for Nerve Injury

# Radial Nerve

The radial nerve is the larger branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) with part of its anatomical course running obliquely around the posterior shaft of the humerus in the spiral groove (Pratt 2005) making it therefore very vulnerable to injury following fracture of the humerus Radial nerve injury can occur secondary to humeral shaft fracture as result of the inappropriate use of axillary crutches or due to entrapment at the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) The radial nerve also has the potential to become entrapped in callus formation during the healing process following humeral fracture (Pratt 2005)

# Radial Tunnel Syndrome

Compression of the radial nerve at the elbow is referred to as radial tunnel syndrome and more commonly affects the posterior interosseus nerve (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) It is commonly seen in racquet sport athletes or swimmers where repetitive pronation and supination occurs (Izzi et al 2001; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) The posterior interosseus nerve is vulnerable to compression at various sites within the radial tunnel (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) of which the arcade of Frohse is one of the hazardous anatomical structures that can compress the nerve at the elbow (Pratt 2005) The arcade of Frohse is fibrous arch formed by the proximal portion of the superficial head of the supinator muscle (Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and under which the radial nerve passes (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006)

Clinically patient with compression of the radial nerve at the elbow will present with poorly localised pain to the antero-lateral aspect of the elbow which can be provoked by manoeuvers that stretch or compress the nerve (Izzi et al 2001) Tenderness over the radial nerve along the radial tunnel pain on resisted supination and positive Tinel's sign over the radial forearm are factors that may be present on physical examination (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) Differential diagnosis for lateral epicondylitis of the elbow is vital as radial tunnel syndrome can masquerade as or co-exist with this condition (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006; Salama and Stanley 2008) Management of radial tunnel syndrome should incorporate pain-relieving modalities such as NSAIDs (Izzi et al 2001; Salama and Stanley 2008) nerve gliding exercises (Badia and Stennett 2006) activity modification and splinting (Izzi et al 2001; Salama and Stanley 2008)

# Median Nerve

The median nerve is formed by contributions from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus (Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) containing motor and sensory fibres from the C5–T1 nerve roots (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) Whilst carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve entrapment of the upper extremity (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) it is more common in the general population as opposed to athletes as the latter typically suffer from nerve compression at the elbow (Izzi et al 2001)

# Pronator Teres Syndrome

Pronator teres syndrome is compression of the median nerve (Izzi et al 2001; Kostopoulos 2004) and is the most common cause of median nerve entrapment at the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) It is more prevalent in athletes as opposed to the general population (Badia and Stennett 2006) with hypertrophy of the pronator teres cited as one of the potential inflictors of compression on the nerve (Izzi et al 2001) External compression on the forearm muscles is another source of medial neuropathy discussed by Badia and Stennett (2006) whereby one of the authors reported medial nerve compression in an acrobat who wrapped curtain of material around the forearm as part of an acrobatic routine during numerous performances thereby repetitively compressing the median nerve and ultimately inflicting injury

The clinical features of pronator teres syndrome are often vague (Kostopolous 2004) However patients with this syndrome may complain of volar arm pain with or without hand pain which may be exacerbated by repeated forearm pronation and wrist flexion (Izzi et al 2001) Numbness in the median nerve distribution with repetitive pronation and supination but not elbow flexion and extension is another indicator of this neuropathy (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) Weakness in resisted forearm

# Pronator Teres Syndrome

Pronation wrist flexion and radial deviation are additional clinical presentations with this condition in addition to thenar atrophy and an inability to oppose or flex the thumb (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) Tenderness on palpation can be evident over the pronator muscle (Izzi et al 2001)

Patients with pronator teres syndrome are advised to abstain from the aggravating activity or modify their choice of equipment or technique (Badia and Stennett; Salama and Stanley 2008) NSAIDs rest (Salama and Stanley 2008) nerve gliding exercises and stretching of the pronator teres muscle are some of the treatment strategies available to clinicians for this neuropathy Splinting is another option presented by Salama and Stanley (2008) for treatment of this condition

# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy in the upper (Shapiro and Preston 2009) involving compression of the median nerve as it traverses through the wrist at the carpal tunnel (Rempel and Diao 2004) and presents relatively frequently in athletes (Aldridge et al 2001) The carpal tunnel is composed of the stiff carpal bones of the wrist which make up the floor and walls of the tunnel and the flexor retinaculum which acts as the roof of the tunnel (Kostopoulos 2004) Nine tendons the medial nerve synovium and radial and ulnar bursae occupy the carpal tunnel (Rempel and Diao 2004) It is therefore quite apparent how this particular area may be subjected to entrapment neuropathy due to the limited space within the tunnel and the high volume of structures occupying this space

CTS is considered to develop as the result of repetitive wrist use and commonly presents in gripping athletes such as archery racquet and throwing athletes (Izzi et al 2001) The syndrome according to Kostopoulos (2004) is defined by the signs and symptoms of the median nerve at the wrist as sensory loss and paresthesia are commonly present in the distribution of the median nerve with this condition (Shapiro and Preston 2009) A thorough investigation of the wrist and cervical spine should be undertaken to eliminate the potential for double crush syndrome (Kostopoulos 2004)

Clinically patients complain of pain in the wrist and hand with paresthesia evident in the lateral three and half fingers (Izzi et al 2001) in addition to reporting nocturnal pain (Aldridge et al 2001; Izzi et al 2001) In chronic conditions symptoms may be reported above the carpal region as far distal as the cervical spine (Kostopoulos 2004) Abductor pollicis weakness is the most common motor weakness associated with CTS (Izzi et al 2001) and diminished grip strength may be evident when compared to the asymptomatic side (Aldridge et al 2001) A positive Tinel’s sign or Phalen's test is indicative of CTS (Aldridge et al 2001; Shapiro and Preston 2009) and thenar atrophy may be observed in advanced cases of CTS (Aldridge et al 2001) Symptoms can be exacerbated during sleep if the wrist is maintained in flexed or extended position (Shapiro and Preston 2009)

Conservative treatment of CTS can include NSAIDs active rest modification of the aggravating activity tendon and nerve gliding (Aldridge et al 2001; Izzi et al 2001; Kostopoulos 2004) and exercise therapy Splinting of the wrist is another treatment option for clinicians for CTS management

# Lower Limb Nerve Injuries

Comprising of the lumbar and sacral plexuses the lumbosacral plexus originates from L1 L2 L3 and in part L4 anterior primary rami (APR) (Wilbourn 2007) The remaining APR of L4 fuses with L5 APR to the lumbosacral trunk which subsequently contributes to the formation of the sacral plexus; an entity responsible for providing sensation to the majority of the lower limb (Wilbourn 2007) The lower branch of L2 all of L3 and the upper branch of L4 terminate by dividing into anterior and posterior divisions; the former forming the obturator nerve and the latter forming the femoral nerve The superior and inferior gluteal nerves are formed by the posterior divisions of L4 L5 and S1 and the posterior divisions of L5 S1 and S2 respectively (Figure 813)

The sacral plexus provides sensation to the gluteal region and with the exception of the anterolateral thigh and lengthy strip of medial leg the lower limb It innervates the pelvic floor muscles gluteals and tensor fascia latae hamstrings and all the muscles of the leg and foot (Wilbourn 2007) Lumbosacral plexopathies are infrequent compared to brachial plexus injury possibly due in part to the protective anatomical arrangement of the pelvis and surrounding musculature in addition to the nerves being associated with less mobile structures (Wilbourn 2007)

# Sciatic Nerve

The sciatic nerve originates from L4 L5 S1 and S2 nerve roots and consists of peroneal and tibial division which are encased in common sheath (Katirji 1999) The sciatic nerve exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic notch before traversing into the posterior thigh where approximately mid-thigh it splits into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve (Yuen and So 1999) The tibial nerve is responsible for innervating the majority of the hamstrings; the short head of biceps femoris being the exception as it is innervated by the common peroneal nerve (Katirji 1999; Yuen and So 1999)

# Piriformis Syndrome

The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior surface of the sacrum inserting into the greater trochanter of the femur (Papadopoulos and Khan 2004) It traverses to its insertion via the sciatic notch; point where all neurovascular structures which enter the buttock from the pelvis descend either superior or inferior to piriformis; the sciatic nerve being one such structure exits the pelvis below the muscle (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004)

Piriformis syndrome arises from the belief that hypertrophied piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve causing pain in the nerve’s distribution (Tiel 2008) theory which is plausible considering the intimate anatomical arrangement between these two structures The resultant effect of this nerve compression is symptoms indicative of proximal sciatic nerve dysfunction neuropathy that has become known as piriformis syndrome (Shapiro and Preston 2009)

A patient presenting with suspected piriformis syndrome generally complains of pain and tenderness in the buttock region at the sciatic notch particularly during prolonged sitting on hard surfaces (Shapiro and Preston 2009) Complaints of buttock pain with or without accompanying ipsilateral radiating pain in the sciatic nerve’s distribution is common; symptoms may be exacerbated by stretching the piriformis via adduction and medial rotation of the hip joint (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Preston 2009) The clinical assessment should include comprehensive neurological examination inclusive of motor sensory and reflex tests (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004) Palpation of the sciatic notch should also be undertaken as this can reproduce symptoms (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Preston 2009) However the intolerance to prolonged sitting on hard surfaces is probably the most prominent sign of this condition (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004); and therefore this condition may be commonly seen in rowers The noticeable difference between piriformis syndrome and L5 radiculopathy is the latter presents with back pain altered reflexes sensory loss and muscle weakness of the hamstrings and gastrocnemius (Shapiro and Preston 2009)

Treatment options for piriformis syndrome should include NSAIDs physical therapy neurodynamic treatment techniques and stretching of the muscle (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Preston 2009) Should conservative treatment fail injection or surgical release are more advanced options according to the same authors

# Posterior Thigh Injury

In athletes presenting with an injury to the posterior thigh there is not automatically an injury to the hamstrings (Woods et al 2004) For example almost 20% of Australian Football League (AFL) players had normal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the hamstrings despite presenting with pain in the posterior thigh (Verrall et al 2001) The consequences of such findings for clinicians is such that in patient presenting with posterior thigh pain where there is difficulty identifying by palpation the painful site lack of bruising vague mechanism of injury or complaints of spinal pain mechanosensitivity of the neural system should be suspected (Butler 1991) The nervous system may incur injury as direct or

# Hamstring Muscle Injury and Nerve Damage

The indirect result of hamstring muscle injury may occur as consequence of the natural formation of scar tissue during the healing process (Shacklock 1995) Fibrosis lesions or intermuscular adhesions following muscle injury can reduce the fluidness of movement between the muscle and the nerve leading to secondary nerve damage (Turl and George 1998; Shacklock 2005)

Considerable overlap in clinical features exists between Grade 1 or minor hamstring muscle strains and injuries involving referred pain (Verrall et al 2003) The clinical signs associated with Grade 2 and 3 muscle strains such as swelling and bruising are typically absent from Grade 1 strains (Kornberg and Lew 1989; Turl and George 1998) making differentiation from referred pain difficult (Kornberg and Lew 1989)

Suspicion of sciatic nerve involvement in hamstring strains is warranted particularly since one in five athletes may have an absence of muscle pathology on MRI scan (Verrall et al 2001) despite presenting clinically as muscle strain As MRI is not easily accessible for many clinicians in sports neurodynamic testing via the slump test is often used to differentially diagnose posterior thigh pain

Treatment of posterior thigh pain if considered muscular should focus on returning the muscle to pre-morbid abilities but the sciatic nerve should not be ignored Slump stretching used in conjunction with traditional treatment modalities (not mobilization) has been shown to significantly decrease recovery time from hamstring injury in professional AFL players (Kornberg and Lew 1989) However no research has evaluated the effect of sliding or tensioning techniques on return to play Sliding or tensioning neurodynamic techniques should be included in the treatment of posterior thigh injury with the selected technique depending on the irritability of the patient’s condition Sliding techniques should be considered in the acute stage management progressing to more aggressive tensioning techniques in the latter stages of rehabilitation

# Peroneal Nerve Injury

The common peroneal nerve (CPN) originating from the sciatic nerve descends through the posterior thigh before traversing the popliteal fossa wrapping around the fibular neck before passing through the fibular tunnel (Katirji 1999) The fibular tunnel is tendinous tunnel between the peroneus longus muscle and the fibula (Katirji 1999) making it common site of compression for this nerve

Peroneal neuropathy is prevalent in individuals who repetitively squat (Shapiro and Preston 2009) such as catchers in baseball as this position can induce prolonged stretching of the nerve It also occurs in individuals with minimal fat due to the lack of adipose tissue available to protect the nerve from external forces or compression (Shapiro and Preston 2009) An acute injury to the CPN may occur in runners where the nerve is forcibly stretched due to severe ankle inversion injury (Shapiro and Preston 2009) while fractures to the fibular head or knee dislocation can also injure this nerve (Katirji 1999)

Patients typically complain of pain burning or numbness down the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg with loss of sensation evident in the dorsum of the foot (Katirji 1999; McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009) Clinical examination may reveal weakness in the ankle evertor muscles (McKean 2009) and the ankle and toe dorsiflexors (Shapiro and Preston 2009) resulting in foot-drop (Katirji 1999) This foot-drop increases susceptibility to falls as the foot may get trapped due to the inability to dorsiflex when walking (Katirji 1999) A positive Tinel’s sign may be present at the fibular neck (Katirji 1999; McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009) and pain can also be reported at the lateral fibular neck (Shapiro and Preston 2009)

Conservative treatment for non-traumatic peroneal neuropathy should include NSAIDs active rest physical therapy and neurodynamic sliding or tensioning techniques such as the SLR with plantarflexion and inversion along with manual therapy In thin athletes padding on the fibular head may be recommended to protect the peroneal nerve from external compressive forces Avoidance of crossing the legs is also advised and ankle bracing should be considered in patients presenting with foot-drop to prevent ankle inversion sprains (Katirji 1999; Shapiro and Preston 2009)

# Peripheral Nerve Injuries

# Tibial Nerve Injury

The tibial nerve originates from the ventral divisions of the L5 S1 and S2 nerve roots and is the largest of the two major divisions of the sciatic nerve (Oh and Meyer 1999) It traverses through the popliteal fossa entering the lower leg between the medial and lateral head of gastrocnemius (Franson and Baravarian 2006) before passing on the medial aspect of the ankle and entering the foot via the tarsal tunnel (Oh and Meyer 1999)

The tarsal tunnel is fibrous-osseous tunnel comprising the flexor retinaculum as the roof and the medial wall of the talus and calcaneus and distal medial aspect of the tibia as the floor (Oh and Meyer 1999; Franson and Baravarian 2006; McKean 2009) Numerous anatomical structures course through the tarsal tunnel such as the tibialis posterior tendon posterior tibial nerve flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum tendons along with numerous blood vessels (Franson and Baravarian 2006) One of the most common entrapment neuropathies of the lower limb is tarsal tunnel syndrome involving the tibial nerve (Oh and Meyer 1999)

# Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome

Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is compression neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve as it passes through the tarsal tunnel at the ankle on the medial side (Franson and Baravarian 2006) The diagnosis of TTS is based on the subjective history and objective examination of patient (Franson and Baravarian 2006) Patients can present with numerous symptoms such as tingling numbness or pain at the toes through the arch of the foot or the heel Prolonged standing or walking may exacerbate symptoms (Franson and Baravarian 2006) making this injury prevalent in hikers or runners who may be vulnerable to TTS (Shapiro and Preston 2009) due to the repetitive ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion that occurs while running (McKean 2009)

An insidious onset of TTS is often reported (Shapiro and Preston 2009) and symptoms can vary depending on the location of the tibial nerve and its branches (McKean 2009) Patients may complain of numbness or tingling and pain in the medial heel arch of the foot or the sole particularly on the medial aspect (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009) These symptoms may increase during running subsequently decreasing with rest (McKean 2009)

The two most prominent clinical signs are positive Tinel’s test and sensory impairment of the terminal branches of the plantar nerve Percussion over the tibial nerve proximal to the upper border of the tarsal tunnel behind the medial malleolus is the best location for the Tinel’s test Evaluating sensory impairment via pin-pricking and comparing it to the non-involved foot is recommended by Oh and Meyer (1999) It is vital to differentially diagnose TTS from L5 or S1 radiculopathy and sensory peripheral neuropathy Lumbosacral radiculopathy generally presents with positive straight leg raise (SLR) weakness of the calf muscles pain radiating from the lower back and negative Tinel’s sign whereas distal sensory peripheral neuropathy has an objective stocking distribution sensory loss in the foot including the dorsum and lateral aspects and an absent Tinel’s sign (Oh and Meyer 1999; Oh 2007)

In TTS there should be no objective sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot although it may be evident on the dorsum of the toes (Oh 2007) Bilateral TTS rarely occurs; however if suspected the presence of distal sensory neuropathy must be considered (Oh 2007) Plantar fasciitis is another condition requiring consideration during the diagnosing process in patients with suspected TTS Plantar fasciitis generally presents with localized pain which is absent of sensory abnormalities; two factors not evident in TTS

As with all the previously mentioned neuropathies conservative treatment can include NSAIDs active rest manual therapy neurodynamic sliding or tensioning techniques and exercise therapy An additional treatment option to consider is using orthotics or modifying footwear to correct any excessive pronation to minimize the stress placed on the tibial nerve (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009)

# Summary

The upper limb being more mobile than the lower extremity is more susceptible to nerve injury Therefore clinicians working in sports should expect higher incidence of upper limb neuropathies than lower limb particularly in athletes participating in contact sports such as rugby union Not all neural injuries in the sporting population will be traumatic in nature particularly for those semi-professional or amateur athletes

Recreational athletes who are in employment and may be susceptible to chronic neuropathies of the upper limb In this particular cohort whereby diversity exists in the type of employment the clinician needs to be aware of neuropathies that can present as consequence of occupation; such as CTS and TOS Rather than being blinkered by neuropathies that typically occur in sport the clinician who has vast array of knowledge of various conditions will not only aid the athletes in their sporting activity but also their activities of daily living

# Case Study

A 30-year-old male football player who competed once week reported sustaining left hamstring injury during game three days prior to initial assessment whereby he felt an “electric” pulse shoot into the ischial tuberosity region and had to stop playing immediately The patient reported lumbar spine stiffness and feeling of being unable to straighten the knee whilst walking He first noticed discomfort in the gluteal area approximately three weeks prior to assessment which was exacerbated whilst driving particularly whilst resting the left foot on the foot pedal However over the three-week period the symptoms gradually increased whereby the patient reported feeling of tightness in the buttock and hamstring during competition and training

During the physical assessment the patient reported stiffness in the lumbar spine and hamstring during lumbar flexion No abnormalities were reported in the sacroiliac joint All passive and resisted hip movements were negative Resisted knee flexion was weak but pain-free whilst all other resisted movements for the knee were normal No bruising was apparent in the gluteal or posterior thigh region The patient reported reproduction of symptoms during the Straight Leg Raise ankle dorsiflexion which was relieved with the release of dorsiflexion Likewise positive slump test in terms of symptom reproduction and decreased knee angle was also observed in both the right and left limb The patient experienced pain on palpation with central posterior-anterior pressure on L4 L5 and S1 vertebrae which were found on palpation to be hypomobile

It was apparent the hamstring strain occurred as bi-product of lumbar spine pathology A core treatment strategy utilised over the course of rehabilitation was the use of neural sliding techniques during the slump test Considering the acuteness and irritability of the condition and the fact neural symptoms had been experienced for three weeks prior to hamstring injury onset sliding techniques were deemed the most appropriate neurodynamic treatment tool The patient was instructed to execute the sliders as frequently as possible particularly if he had been driving for significant period of time Manual therapy and home exercise programme of stabilisation exercises were also implemented into the patient’s treatment plan to address the underlying lumbar spine problem Finally progressive rehabilitation programme for the hamstrings was also implemented Three weeks following injury the patient returned to competition

# Periodisation

Probably the most influential factor behind recent advances in sports performance is the greater understanding shown by coaches athletes and sports scientists of Training Theory Central to this is the concept of periodisation or the structured and sequential planning of training to allow the athlete to make optimal gains in sports performance and produce their best performances in key competitions with minimal risk of overtraining or injury Previous research has also demonstrated that compared to non-periodised training programmes periodised training programmes result in greater increases in strength power and sports performance (Fleck 1999; Fleck 2002; Rhea and Alderman 2004)

Specifically periodisation involves the planned and structured variation in training type volume (intensity and duration) and rest to achieve sport-specific goals This is achieved via the periodical progression of specific aspects of fitness within specified time frame This style of programme allows for gradual and progressive overload ensuring an optimal stimulus for adaptation whilst allowing adequate time for recovery and adaptation

Progressive overload is essential in all aspects of physical training whether the aim is to optimise performance improve image or rehabilitate an injury In periodised model the athlete progresses through phases (meso-cycles) each of which targets specific fitness attribute but which is planned such that the intensity and specificity advances from phase to phase and culminates in the athlete reaching their peak of sport-specific fitness at the exact time of key competitions For example subsequent phases may focus on basic anatomical and functional adaptations (increased range of motion increased tendon strength improved coordination and increased stability) strength endurance maximal strength power and ultimately sport-specific speed and power Such progression requires appropriate adjustments in the frequency intensity and duration of individual training sessions and the appropriate selection of exercises sets and repetitions within each session (For more detail on recommended sets repetitions and loads see Chapter 13 Strength and Conditioning)

With this in mind periods of training are divided into smaller more manageable chunks that allow the athlete to maintain both physical and mental throughout

This chapter will focus on training cycles and their specific goals and will consider how best to integrate these into performance injury prevention and rehabilitation goals with specific emphasis on ensuring the athlete’s readiness to perform

By the end of this chapter the reader should have better knowledge of periodisation and its different phases an understanding of the application of periodisation to injury prevention and rehabilitation

# Table 91: Training Phase Descriptions

|Cycle|Size|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Macro-cycle|Large block Represents several months or even years|The training year; whole Olympiad|
|Meso-cycle|Medium block Usually consisting of number of weeks or months of training|Often with specific focus such as strength endurance maximal strength power peaking active rest aerobic endurance or anaerobic threshold|
|Micro-cycles|Smaller blocks of time|Individual training day/week|

Most effective training programmes break training down into cycles This allows athletes to focus on different attributes at different times helps with the prevention of overtraining and is convenient as training can be made to coincide with our own cycles (for example weeks seasons years and Olympiads) Training cycles can last from days to years and depending on their length are termed macro-cycles meso-cycles and micro-cycles

A macro-cycle represents several months or years for example the general conditioning period the whole training year or the four years of an Olympiad A meso-cycle is smaller block usually consisting of number of weeks or months of training (usually prioritised towards particular training outcome such as strength endurance maximal strength power peaking active rest aerobic endurance or anaerobic threshold) interspersed with periods of reduced training to facilitate rejuvenation In this way meso-cycles can be structured to maximise the recuperative effects of the recovery periods and minimise the risk of overtraining Micro-cycles are smaller blocks such as an individual training day/week

Many coaches use 4-week cycle where the training load increases up to week three followed by an easier (unloading) week to allow full recovery (usually decrease in volume but not intensity) This is basic of shock training with the four weeks termed ordinary development shock and recovery (Matveyev 1981) A meso-cycle typically consists of one or two full 4-week cycles A 4-week meso-cycle may look like the following:

A meso-cycle that uses such 4-week training block places great deal of short-term accumulative stress on the It is possible that full recovery between sessions or even micro-cycles is not achieved until week four Prior to this the athlete will accumulate fatigue as the overall training load increases

# Training Load/Volume

Figure 92 illustrates an example of an 8-week micro-cycle meso-cycle

The training cycle can have implications for the trainability of particular fitness attributes (Balyi 2001) For example the training of speed maximal strength technique and the learning of new skills should be emphasized during the early weeks of each four-week cycle when the athlete is relatively fresh and receptive to such methods During later weeks the most trainable attributes will be cardiovascular endurance anaerobic power local muscular endurance and speed endurance The improvements in fitness from such pattern of training are illustrated in Figure 93

# The Training Year

The most common macro-cycle is the training year which consists of number of meso-cycles and micro-cycles Every training year consists of preparation phase performance phase and recuperation phase (Figure 94) which vary in length depending on the competition schedule of each particular sport

The preparation phase itself may be considered in greater detail and further divided into general preparation period specific preparation period and pre-competition period (Matveyev 1965) This gives training year with five distinct phases:

- General-conditioning period
- Specific-conditioning period
- Pre-competition period
- Competition (or performance) period
- Transition (or recuperation) period

# General Conditioning Period

The aim of the general conditioning period is to develop broad base of fitness that acts as foundation

**Table 92: Phases of the Training Year**
|Phase|Description|
|---|---|
|General-conditioning period|Focus on developing broad base of fitness|
|Specific-conditioning period|Targeted training for specific fitness attributes|
|Pre-competition period|Preparation for upcoming competitions|
|Competition (performance) period|Peak performance during competitions|
|Transition (recuperation) period|Recovery and transition to the next training cycle|

# Table 9: Training Phases

|Phases of the Training Year (Matveyev 1965)|Aim|
|---|---|
|General Conditioning Period|To develop broad base of fitness involving strength power local muscular endurance cardiovascular fitness and flexibility|
|Specific Conditioning Period and Pre-Competition Period|To provide progressive transition from the broad general fitness towards the highly specific fitness required by competition|
|Competition (or Performance) Period|To maintain their hard-earned fitness remain injury-free and peak for key competitions|
|Transition (or Recuperation) Period|To achieve full recuperation in readiness for the general preparation period ahead|

# Specific Conditioning and Pre-Competition Period

The aim of this phase is to provide progressive transition from the broad general fitness towards the highly specific fitness required by competition This period predominantly focuses on strength endurance (8–20 repetitions 3–5 sets 3–4 days per week) (Plisk and Stone 2003) but also includes some power exercises cardiovascular fitness flexibility training and technique work This phase is characterised by progressive increase in both volume (primary aim) and intensity (secondary aim) of training

Note: Although this period is about general preparation athletes should not neglect their practice of sport-specific skills These skills should be incorporated into the training via dedicated short duration high quality practices or included as part of functional dynamic warm-up This will help ensure that athletes maintain the skills and coordination required in competition

For example during this period sprinters may be focusing many of their track sessions on speed endurance rather than pure speed This however does not preclude the athletes performing short bursts of maximum speed running or quick feet coordination drills as part of their warm-up

# Competition Period

The length of the competition period varies for different sports (soccer — 9 months athletics — 3–4 months cricket — 5 months); however the aims remain the same Athletes need to maintain their hard-earned fitness optimise performance remain injury-free and peak for key competitions

# Training Cycles

# Training Cycles

Training usually focuses on lower volume strength and power-based activities (2–3 repetitions 3–5 sets 3–6 days per week depending on frequency of competition) (Plisk and Stone 2003)

# Transition/Recuperation Period/Active Rest

This period usually lasts around month depending on the sport the stresses of the previous competitive season and the timing of the next one The aims are to achieve full recuperation in readiness for the general preparation period ahead This period allows any injuries to heal and period of rehabilitation to occur so that the athlete is ready to resume full training It is also time of relaxation and enjoyment The stresses of competitive sport are far more than just physical Athletes need time to unwind and relax Rest should be taken from the hard training and competition but athletes must also remain active and partake in activities unrelated to their sport This helps with weight management but also enables the athlete to maintain degree of general fitness going into the general preparation phase The activities should be novel and fresh and not too demanding (low volume: 1–3 repetitions 1–3 sets similar 3 days per week) (Plisk and Stone 2003) A similar strategy can be adopted when peaking/tapering for competition

# Meso-Cycles of Training

There are specific goals for each meso-cycle of training (usually completed in the order below) as proposed by Bompa (1999) These phases include:

- Anatomical adaptation – the development of technique and preparation of the musculoskeletal system (including connective tissues) for the heavier loads used in the following stages (these are usually addressed in the general conditioning phase)
- Hypertrophy (strength endurance) – high volume (repetitions of 8–20 at 50–80% –1RM for 4–6 sets)
- Strength – which can be subdivided into:
- Maximal strength (repetitions of 3–6 at 80–90% –1RM for 4–8 sets)
- Speed strength (repetitions of 8–15 at less than 70% –1RM for 3–4 sets)
- Strength endurance (repetitions of 20–30 at 30–40% –1RM for 2–3 sets) (Plisk and Stone 2003)
- Power – can be trained via two primary methods; plyometrics and variations of the ‘Olympic lifts’ However it is worth noting that few athletes ‘naturally’ have the attributes to perform ‘Olympic lifts’ safely and effectively and therefore this needs to be developed in the early stages of training (McGill 2006) It is also important to select the component of the lift that is most suitable for the training goal for example lower limb biomechanics during the second pull is similar to the mechanics of vertical jump During ‘Olympic lifts’ and their variations it is not necessary to use maximal load as Kawamori et al (2005) showed that lighter loads (50–70% –1RM) resulted in greater power output due to higher velocity Cormie et al (2007a 2007b) also demonstrated that when performing activities (such as jump squats) optimal loading to achieve peak power is achieved using only mass with no additional external resistance

These phases but especially the anatomical adaptation phase need to take into account the ‘laws of strength training’ and the principles of ‘functional training’ (Table 93) to ensure that the individual is appropriately conditioned to perform the more advanced training

# Table 93: Laws of Strength Training and Functional Training

|Laws of Strength Training (Bompa 1999)|Functional Training (McGill 2006)|
|---|---|
|Develop joint flexibility (active ROM)|Develop tendon strength|
|Develop core strength|Develop stabilisers and fixators (balance between agonists and antagonists)|
|Train movements not muscles|Develop intra-muscular coordination of fibres within muscle (fast and slow twitch)|
|Develop inter-muscular coordination between muscle groups (efficiency of movement)|Develop facilitatory and inhibitory reflex pathways (optimal efficiency through the kinetic chain affected by balance and posture)|
|Motor learning (optimal efficiency of specific movement)| |

# An Introduction to Periodisation

# Intense Phases of Training

The approach to periodisation will not only reduce the risk of injury but also ensure that each phase of training is as productive as possible/intended

# Differences Between Sports

The length of the preparation competition transition periods and associated meso-cycles changes from sport to sport and athlete to athlete
For example track and field athlete may have two or three key competitions throughout the course of three-month competitive season
The rest of the year is effectively preparation for these key competitions In contrast an English Premiership football team may only have six- or seven-week preparation period preceding nine-month competitive season
during which players are expected to compete on weekly or twice-weekly basis Swimmers often have major competitions arranged on 13- or 14-week cycles
Professional boxers may have between three and four fights year with their training always geared towards preparation for the next fight
Despite the different conditions encountered during the preparation for these sports the following general principles still apply:
 gradual build-up in volume (and intensity) early on; as the competition approaches the intensity or quality increases further whilst the volume tapers off

# Application to Sports Performance

For athletes with limited training experience the incorporation of periodisation plan provides an excellent framework to develop an athlete’s lifting skills as well as their strength and power
For example if an individual wishes to compete in Olympic weightlifting but has never actually completed structured resistance training programme
they need to start with the basic components of the ‘Olympic’ lifts and progress to the point where they are as strong as possible in each of these components
while they learn the complete ‘Olympic’ lifts Each meso-cycle should teach progressively more complex components of the lifts to ensure correct technique and to allow for the appropriate anatomical and functional adaptations
(neuromuscular control active range of motion joint stability tendon strength) to occur until the complete lifts (snatch and clean and jerk) can be performed

By the end of the first macro-cycle the athlete should be confident/competent at performing each of the primary lifts but should have also developed considerable level of strength in the key exercises
(back squat front squat overhead squat deadlift Romanian deadlift) During the next macro-cycle the athlete can focus on developing additional strength in each of the key exercises of the individual lifts
while progressively increasing load on the ‘Olympic lifts’ This allows the athlete to perform the primary lifts with additional weight whilst maintaining good technique at high velocities to ensure the development of power

The next macro-cycle should place greater emphasis on the loads lifted during the clean and jerk and the snatch The previous phase should have ensured adequate anatomical adaptations during each of the components of the lifts
to ensure adequate conditioning for the lifts to be performed at higher loads To ensure that the client can decelerate during the catch phase of the snatch
initial deceleration training begins with drop jumps and then progresses to snatch balances which mimic the catch phase of the snatch and develop adequate trunk strength to decelerate the torso and bar during the rapid descent to the catch phase;
 similar progression can also be seen for the clean (drop jumps clean balance) and the split jerk (split squat overhead split squat)
It is also essential that the velocity of each movement is trained in progressive manner as can be seen in the progression from military press to push press

Olympic lifts are commonly used within strength and conditioning programs due to the fact that increases in performance in these lifts have been shown to increase athletic performance
Appropriate conditioning and preparation for these athletes is essential to ensure that they are adequately prepared to perform these types of exercises

As mentioned above each phase has specific role which ensures that the athlete is appropriately conditioned for the subsequent phase
Anatomical adaptation focuses on the development of

# Understanding Periodisation in Rehabilitation

An understanding of periodisation is essential for complete and effective rehabilitation This applies both to the phases of progression through rehabilitation but also to an understanding of the training year of the particular sport to which the athlete is returning For example multiple sprint sport athlete (football rugby hockey) has had their ACL

The athlete has regained 'normal' range of motion (ROM) and can perform activities of daily living without any problems or pain The athlete wants to begin training with the squad and playing in matches However most non-contact ACL injuries occur during rapid deceleration and cutting maneuvers (Agel 2005) or during landing (Boden et al 2000a 2000b) which both involve high velocity high force eccentric loading

'Normal' ACL rehabilitation does not appropriately condition the athlete for such demands; therefore it is essential that the rehabilitation process is specific to the demands of the sport To achieve this it is essential to understand the mechanisms of ACL injury Recent evidence suggests that decreased activation and possible inadequate strength in the gluteus medius especially in female athletes can lead to increased knee valgus (Zazulak et al 2005; Hanson et al 2008) which is common factor in acute ACL injury

Other causative factors include poor/inappropriate technique with limited knee flexion during deceleration; muscle imbalance between hamstring and quadriceps (hamstring:quadriceps ratio less than 06) (Li et al 1999; Ahmed 2006) or an eccentric hamstring to concentric quadriceps ratio less than 10 (Holcomb et al 2007); delayed activation of the hamstrings especially in females (Hewett et al 1996; Malinzak et al 2001; Zazulak et al 2005) both of which can result in increased knee valgus during eccentric loading (Markolf et al 1995; Malinzak et al 2001; Ford et al 2003; McLean 2004; Hewett et al 2005a)

To reduce the risk of non-contact ACL injuries and their recurrence it is essential that the athlete is appropriately conditioned to cope with rapid deceleration (high velocity eccentric loading) and changes in direction (high velocity eccentric loading followed immediately by high velocity concentric muscle actions – plyometric movements) As females generally appear to be quadriceps dominant during deceleration in landing and cutting maneuvers (Hanson et al 2008) it is essential that adequate gluteus medius and maximus strength is developed (this must be developed in functional manner)

Figure 9period12: Catch position for the clean and bottom of the front squat and front squat drop jumps

Eccentric hamstring exercises such as Nordic hamstring lowers are more effective than concentric training (Kaminski et al 1998; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Kilgallon et al 2007) improving the hamstring: quadriceps ratio especially at higher velocities (Mjolsnes et al 2004; Holcomb et al 2007) This type of activity will also condition the muscles for the specific eccentric component required during deceleration albeit at slower velocity

Based on the periodisation model and taking into account the current research and guidelines on plyometric training there are number of phases (mesocycles) required to train the athlete to point where they are appropriately conditioned for return to their sport

The end stage for the athlete is to be able to perform high-intensity plyometric movements; however in order for them to be able to perform high-intensity plyometrics safely it is recommended that the athlete is sufficiently conditioned

# Notes:

1 Cormie et al (2007a 2007b) demonstrated that peak power was achieved during jump squats when mass alone was used as resistance when taking mass into account

2 Stone et al (2003) had previously reported peak power to be achieved using 10% 1–RM squat during jump squat however they did not assess peak power during an unloaded jump squat Their results demonstrated decrease in peak power in direct relationship with an increase in load

3 Cormie et al (2007a 2007b) also demonstrated that peak power during power cleans is achieved at 80% 1–RM

4 Kawamori et al (2005) demonstrated that load of 70% or 1–RM during hang power clean results in the greatest peak power output Hori et al (2008) have also shown significant relationship ( < 005) between hang power clean performance and 20m sprint performance therefore increasing performance in the hang power clean may result in improved acceleration over the initial 20m

5 Rest for 5–10 seconds between each repetition to prevent fatigue and maintain velocity

6 Cormie et al (2007a) demonstrated that combining lower strength and power training is more effective than power training alone at increasing power especially against additional resistance Therefore the example programme above combines both strength and power based activities but alters the focus from maximising strength in the general preparation phases to optimising power during the pre-competition phase

7 Peak power during the jump squat (50–70% 1–RM) and split jump squat (30–60% 1–RM) are related to initial acceleration during sprints as assessed by 5-m sprint times (Sleivert and Taingahue 2004) Thomas et al (2007) showed gender effect on optimal power load during the jump squat with 30–40% 1–RM as the optimal load for females and 30–50% 1–RM as the optimal load for males

# Notes

Note 1: During the initial introduction of the single leg squat and back squat it is essential that the exercise is performed within pain-free range of motion (ROM) which may initially be limited If this is the case it is essential to continue to develop active ROM in the joint

Note 2: During the initial introduction of the Deadlift it is essential that the exercise is performed within pain-free ROM which may initially be limited and require the bar to be elevated onto blocks to decrease the level of knee flexion required If this is the case it is essential to continue to develop active ROM in the joint

Note 3: Drop jump landings should focus on force acceptance (deceleration) while focusing on the correct landing technique This can be progressed in terms of intensity by increasing the height of the step/platform from which the exercise is performed Alternatively the intensity and difficulty of the movement can be increased by progressing to single leg drop jump landings

# Physio Knowledge - Summary

# Summary

# Table 97: Progression of Example Programme

|Meso-Cycle|Aim|
|---|---|
|Meso-cycle 1: Anatomical Adaptations|Develop ROM and technique in each exercise including split squats as unilateral exercise with low level deceleration|
|Meso-cycle 2: Strength Endurance|Increase muscular endurance improve technique introduce correct landing technique and higher speed deceleration training|
|Meso-cycle 3: Hypertrophy|Transitional phase from strength endurance to strength phase|
|Meso-cycle 4: Strength|Increase strength introduce focused eccentric loading of hamstrings to further improve H:Q ratio|
|Meso-cycle 5: Maximal Strength|Optimize strength prior to speed strength development in preparation for plyometric training|
|Meso-cycle 6: Speed Strength (High Velocity)|Progressively decrease loading from 90–95% –1RM down to 40% –1RM while progressively increasing velocity of movements in preparation for full integration of plyometric training|

# Key Development Stages

- Developing lower limb control during bilateral and then unilateral exercises
- Developing pain-free ROM for full-depth squat while addressing the hamstring to quadriceps ratio
- Developing strength in squatting movements progressing to the point that the athlete can correctly squat 15 times mass pain-free through full ROM
- Low intensity plyometric movements such as low-level drop jumps should be practiced to ensure that the athlete has the appropriate foot placement limb movement balance and posture
- Plyometric movements should be integrated beginning with primarily vertical movements followed by forward momentum then lateral movements finally progressing to multidirectional movements which gradually become more sport-specific

# Considerations for Conditioning Programmes

It is essential that during conditioning programme the athlete still addresses other issues such as ensuring restoration of adequate range of motion for their sport whilst prioritising the training of correct landing cutting and deceleration strategies to minimise the risk of recurrence of ACL injury during their skill training

As long as the athlete exhibits all of the prerequisites for plyometric training identified above by the end of micro-cycle 5 they should be able to progress to full plyometric training programme after micro-cycle 6

Plyometric training should also be progressive and periodised to allow improvement in terms of increasing velocity of movement or deceleration forces depending on the aims of the athlete and the requirements of the sport At the same time it is essential to continue with some strength training to prevent detraining effect and therefore loss of strength Progression for sport-specific activities should develop from unidirectional to bidirectional to multidirectional movements

# Conclusion

Although periodisation has previously been used primarily by strength and conditioning coaches to optimise performance for specific competitions the same approach can be used in the development of both rehabilitation programmes and injury prevention programmes This approach ensures that

# Management of Acute Sport Injury

# Jeffrey Aperiod Russell

# University of California Irvine

# Introduction and Aims

The experience of acute injury can be devastating to an athlete Catastrophic injury is an obvious example but even less severe occurrences can adversely affect an athlete because of fears and thoughts of the unknown:
- How severe is it?
- Can I carry on playing?
- What if I have to sit out – for how long?
- Will I lose my place on the team?

All of these and many more can negatively impact situation that is already antithetical to sport “activity” Thus the sport rehabilitator and the rest of the healthcare team must ensure that the management of acute injury creates the best environment possible for successful return of the athlete to full function With this as the ultimate goal the aims of the chapter are to:

1 Describe the nature and occurrence patterns of acute sport injury
2 Present general plan for assessing acute sport injury
3 Recommend appropriate methods for managing acute sport injury
4 Provide foundation on which to base more detailed presentations of specific injuries in various regions

# Common Acute Injuries in Sport

# Injury Epidemiology

Intuitively it is not possible to eliminate injuries in sport; however the incidence of injuries can be reduced For the year 2002 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Injuries reported 710018 injuries in the United Kingdom in activities classified as sport (excluding in educational venues) running cycling or riding (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 2009) The UK’s Leisure Accident Surveillance System (LASS) estimated that the total number of sport injuries occurring in the United Kingdom in 2002 (the last year for which data are available) was 824182 (Department of Trade and Industry 2003) More than 525000 of these occurred in ball sports where implements (eg sticks bats) were not used This reflects the immense popularity – and the high injury rates – of football and rugby

Football injury rates have been reported to be 259 per 1000 player-match hours (ie injuries occurring in matches) and 34 per 1000 player-training hours (ie injuries occurring in training) in England’s Premiership and First and Second professional divisions (Hawkins and Fuller 1999) Rugby’s injury rate is even higher: in preparation for and participation in the Rugby World Cup by the England national team injury rates were reported as 218 per 1000 player-match hours and 61 injuries per 1000 player-training hours with an overall rate of 17 injuries per 1000 hours (Brooks et al 2005) In the 2007 Rugby World Cup epidemiology study injury rates for all teams taken together were reported at 839 injuries per 1000 player-match hours and 35 injuries per 1000 player-training hours (Fuller et al 2008)

Sadly LASS only offers raw statistics without epidemiological interpretation; research studies add valuable context to these figures

# Management of Acute Sport Injury

Clarity to the data However it is clear that all sports carry inherent risk of injury for participants It is therefore important to understand the epidemiological terms related to injury
Incidence is the number of new occurrences of an injury or illness in given time period and prevalence is the number of injuries that are present in given population at specified time (Anonymous 2005; Caine et al 2006)

Three specific terms have been presented in the context of analysing sport injury incidence (Knowles et al 2006):
- Incidence proportion: The number of injured athletes divided by the number of athletes at risk representing the average risk of injury for an athlete
- Incidence rate: Refers to the number of injuries in given quantity of time
- Clinical incidence: The overall number of injuries that occur in given group of athletes important for decisions about how to allot clinical resources to healthcare settings

One of the key factors of any systematic injury survey that provides data about acute injury epidemiology is the definition of injury and related parameters (van Mechelen et al 1996; Ekstrand and Karlsson 2003; Brooks and Fuller 2006; Hodgson et al 2007)
The National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Injury Surveillance System (ISS) has recorded injuries in university athletes in America since 1982 (National Collegiate Athletic Association 2008)
A reportable injury is defined in this database as one that:

Occurs as result of participation in an organized intercollegiate [ie inter-university] practice or competition; requires medical attention by [healthcare professional]; and results in restriction of the student-athlete’s participation or performance for one or more days beyond the day of injury

In other words an episode is not considered an injury until at minimum; it compromises an athlete’s ability to participate in their sport on the day following the episode
This definition is not universal however Hodgson et al (2007) recommend much more encompassing definition
Contrast of the foregoing classification with the following underscores the difficulty in comparing injury rates among research articles
King et al (2009) recommended this definition of injury for the entirety of rugby league:

Any pain or disability that occurs during participation in rugby league match or training activities that is sustained by player irrespective of the need for match or training time loss or for first aid or medical attention An injury that results in player requiring first aid or medical attention is referred to as “medical attention injury” and an injury that results in the player being unable to partake in full part of future training and/or match activities is referred to as “time loss” injury

The dissimilarity with the ISS definition is obvious and substantial Analogous variation exists as well between the ISS and King et al definitions of exposure
An “athlete exposure” is the ISS’s basic measure of risk being defined as one athlete participating in one training session or one competition in which they are exposed to the potential for being injured (National Collegiate Athletic Association 2008)
The definition provided by King et al (2009) is:

[For matches] The product of the number of players the number of matches between two different teams and the match duration for the period that the study is being conducted The recommended recording of exposure time is the duration of the matches being studied in hours

[For training] The product of the number of players the number of training sessions and the training duration for the period that the study is being conducted The recommended recording of exposure time is the duration of the training sessions being studied in hours

In study of the ISS for the years 1988–2004 (Hootman et al 2007) injuries are statistically more likely to occur during competitions than during training (138 versus 40 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures)
Also injuries during pre-season training were significantly higher (66 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures) than injuries occurring during sport’s season (23 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures) and after the season (14 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures)
The general tendencies of these results – if not the injury rates – are similar to observations made about rugby injuries in England (Brooks et al 2008) and Australia (Gabbett 2004)
Another interesting finding is that across all sports university male athletes are 35 times more likely to suffer non-time-loss injury than time-loss injury (Powell and Dompier 2004)

1 Catastrophic and non-catastrophic risks combined; higher number indicates greater relative risk 8 is maximum

2 Higher number indicates more healthcare required; 40 is maximum

Female athletes are over 5 times more likely to suffer non-time-loss injury The relative need for healthcare delivery to participants of given sport is pertinent topic in any discussion about sport injury incidence A very useful tool for determining the healthcare requirements of variety of sports has been proposed and is based on injury incidence rate and the relative personnel load of providing care for injuries incurred in university sports (National Athletic Trainers’ Association 2007) Injury rate index is based on risk of injury combined with risk of catastrophic (brain and spine) injury A higher Health Care Index suggests that sport requires more medical attention While comparable data for cricket and rugby could not be found the information presented is helpful for the sport rehabilitator’s understanding about the nature of injury in sport and the demand for healthcare each sport engenders

# Specific Injuries Encountered

It is surprisingly difficult to locate summary data on the incidences of specific injuries in sport Apart from the epidemiological challenges previously outlined there are some practical reasons for this Countless articles offer reports about injuries in certain sports but assessing these systematically is monstrous task In addition the types of injuries sustained by children adolescents young adults middle-aged adults and senior adults likely differ as do injuries encountered in recreational sport competitive sport and sport training Combine these diversities with the variety in sports rules equipment venues training regimens and healthcare access across the globe and the task of assessing sport injury epidemiology appears overwhelming at best The USA’s National Collegiate Athletic Association maintains excellent data for university athletes that offer some insight into those regions that are most affected and those injuries that occur most commonly in certain sports (Hootman et al 2007) Selected data are provided in Tables 102 and 103

# Initial Assessment of Acute Sport Injury

Assessment of all injuries in sport participants should follow the standard history inspection (observation) palpation and special testing paradigm commonly applied by healthcare professionals These steps can be summarised as follows (for greater detail read Chapter 11: Musculoskeletal Assessment)

# Injury Evaluation Questions

- How did the injury occur?
- Did you hear or feel pop crack snap or other unusual sensation?
- Have you injured this area previously?
- How does it feel now compared to when the injury first occurred?
- How is the injury limiting your activity?
- When did this happen?
- What were you doing at the time of the injury?

# Inspection (Observation)

This step requires careful visual analysis of the injured area and adjacent regions Several pieces of information are collected before the examiner touches the injured area The contralateral limb should be used for comparison as long as it does not exhibit atypical characteristics because of prior injury or other reason Examples of observational information to gather about the type and extent of injury include:

- Deformity (eg joint incongruity limb angulations anatomical landmark displacement)
- Swelling

# Initial Assessment of Acute Sport Injury

# Initial Assessment of Acute Sport Injury

# Key Observations

- Discolouration (eg pallor ecchymosis erythema)
- Gait discrepancies or difficulties
- Difficulties climbing to the examination couch
- Reduction in joint range of motion

# Palpation

This is the first instance when the examiner actually touches the injured athlete A systematic probing of the injured area and surrounding tissues gains important details and may help the clinician identify pathologies that accompany the primary injury The contralateral limb is used as reference Examples of findings from effective palpation include:

- Localisation of pain and tenderness (including deciding which structures are painful and which are not as part of differential diagnostic process)
- Atypical anatomical contours
- Crepitus
- Effusion and oedema

# Special Testing

Following completion of the history inspection and palpation steps the examiner conducts series of assessments to gather further insight into the nature and severity of the injury These vary widely depending on the region being evaluated and the diagnostic clues gained in the first portion of the examination The following tests are commonly used for knee injuries:

- Apprehension sign for patellar dislocation/subluxation
- Lachman’s test for anterior cruciate ligament integrity
- Anterior drawer test for anterior cruciate ligament integrity
- Posterior gravity sign for posterior cruciate ligament integrity
- Pivot shift test for anterolateral rotary instability
- McMurray’s test for meniscal damage
- Apley’s grind test for meniscal damage
- Ottawa Knee Rules (Stiell et al 1995 1996; Tigges et al 1999) to rule out fracture

# Assessment Case Study: Ankle Sprain

One of the most common injuries in sport is ankle sprain (Garrick 1977; Yeung et al 1994; Fong et al 2007; Hootman et al 2007) so it will serve as an example of how acute injury evaluation is applied The sport rehabilitator confronted with this type of ankle injury will assign severity grade to the sprain based on the results of the clinical examination (see Table 104) A partially torn ligament – categorised as grade 2 sprain – can encompass wide range of damage whilst grade 3 sprain is complete rupture

|Grade 3|Completely torn (ruptured)|Moderate to severe instability; soft or indistinct endpoint|Moderate to severe|

The determination by the examiner of limit – or an endpoint – to their stress exam of the joint is important The endpoint is created by any remaining intact ligament restricting the movement A grade 3 sprain does not exhibit such limit; rather an indistinct soft endpoint is present because the torn ligament cannot oppose the stress the examiner places on the ankle

However the examiner must remember that many subjective subtleties exist in evaluating ligament damage because there are virtually infinite ways that ligaments supporting joint can be injured The amount of joint instability may be graded instead of the degree of injury to specific ligament (Hildebrand et al 2007) For instance grade 2 instability may be present when one ligament is completely torn and the others around joint are not But partial tears to two or more ligaments about the joint may also result in the same type of instability This underscores the need for the sport rehabilitator to practice systematic method of ligament injury evaluation

# Acute Ankle Injury: History

There are certain customary questions to ask an injured athlete and some of these depend on the region involved A framework of “What When Where How?” may be helpful It is ideal to develop routine examination methodology in order to facilitate the process and ensure one does not miss important diagnostic clues

Examiner:

What happened to your ankle?

Player:

I jumped up for rebound and when I came down my foot landed on top of Ian’s and it rolled over

Examiner:

When did this occur?

Player:

Yesterday afternoon during training

Examiner:

What did you feel when it happened?

Player:

It hurt lot and I felt it pop

Examiner:

Has it been painful since the injury occurred?

Player:

It hurt loads when it happened but I just walked it off Later it felt better and I’ve been able to carry on with life OK

Examiner:

How does it feel now?

Player:

It still hurts but not as much

Examiner:

Have you ever hurt this ankle before?

Player:

No

Examiner:

How about the other one?

Player:

No not at all

Examiner:

OK I’m going to examine it now

# Acute Ankle Injury: Inspection

At this point the examiner looks carefully at both the injured and uninjured ankles to assess swelling ecchymosis (bluish discolouration) and other visible signs that may add information to the assessment The athlete’s ankle exhibits an area of swelling anterior to the lateral malleolus that is approximately the size of tennis ball

Examiner:

Where would you say it hurts the most? Can you place one finger at that spot?

Player:

The player points to location about 15 cm anterior to the lateral malleolus; this is an area over the anterior talofibular ligament and the spot where the swelling is located There are no other areas of swelling nor are there other outward signs of injury

# Initial Assessment of Acute Sport Injury

# Examiner's Assessment

Examiner: Can you show me the way your ankle and foot turned when you landed on Ian’s foot?

The player demonstrates an inversion movement of the foot with slight plantar flexion

# Palpation of Acute Ankle Injury

First the examiner palpates the uninjured extremity in order to familiarize the player with the process and to reduce his apprehension Then the examiner begins to gently palpate various places about the foot ankle and leg of the player’s injured limb starting with areas that are not likely to be painful in order to keep the player at ease It is crucial that the clinician be well versed in clinical anatomy for this portion of the injury examination Locations and structures the examiner palpates are:

# Ligaments (to investigate possible sprains)

- Deltoid ligament
- Anterior talofibular ligament
- Calcaneofibular ligament
- Anterior tibiofibular ligament
- Calcaneocuboid ligament

# Bones (to investigate the possibility of associated fractures)

- Base of the 5th metatarsal to assess an avulsion fracture
- Metaphysis and diaphysis of the 5th metatarsal to assess shaft fracture or Jones (proximal diaphyseal/metaphyseal) fracture
- Lateral malleolus
- Fibula extending up the leg to the fibular neck in order to assess Maisonneuve fracture
- Dorsal talus
- Navicular
- Calcaneus

# Tendons and Muscles (to investigate possible strains)

- Achilles tendon

The examiner does not note any pain or crepitus on bony structures so the suspicion for fracture is low Palpating the soft tissue structures does not elicit pain except for the anterior talofibular ligament; this is accompanied by sensation of ballottement as the examiner presses over the swollen tissue

# Special Testing for Acute Ankle Injury

Now the examiner proceeds to the final phase of the injury evaluation Once again the contralateral side receives attention first; the player reported no history of injury to this side so it will serve as “normal” for comparison purposes The following tests are performed there and then repeated on the injured limb:

- Eversion (varus) stress test to evaluate the deltoid ligament
- Forcing the foot into dorsiflexion to evaluate the anterior tibiofibular ligament (this forces slight separation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis)
- Twisting the foot in the ankle mortise to evaluate the anterior tibiofibular ligament (this also separates the syndesmosis)
- Inversion (valgus) stress test in anatomical position (ankle neutral) to evaluate the calcaneofibular ligament
- Inversion stress test in plantar flexion to evaluate the anterior talofibular ligament
- Anterior drawer test with the ankle in neutral position to evaluate the anterior talofibular ligament

The examiner must be careful to not fall into the trap of finalizing an injury diagnosis without gathering all potentially useful information with thorough history inspection palpation and special testing protocol Many inexperienced clinicians have been

Table 105 (Stiell et al 1992 1994; Leddy et al 2002; Nugent 2004)

|Condition|Criteria for X-ray|
|---|---|
|Ankle|- The posterior half of the distal 6 cm of the fibula or tibia or tip of the lateral malleolus is painful to palpation
- AND the patient cannot bear weight for 4 steps on the injured limb at the time of injury and at the time of the evaluation (limping is irrelevant)
|
|Midfoot|- The base of the 5th metatarsal or the navicular bone is painful to palpation
- AND the patient cannot bear weight for 4 steps on the injured limb at the time of injury and at the time of the evaluation (limping is irrelevant)
|

It is important to assess an injury carefully to avoid misdiagnosis In the case of basketball player who inverted and plantar flexed his ankle upon landing on another player's foot this mechanism is typical of an anterior talofibular ligament sprain (Garrick 1977) However completing thorough assessment will help identify other potentially injured structures

# Assessment Results

Our basketball player exhibits the following results of ligament testing:

- Eversion stress: Not painful and no instability (firm endpoint) compared to contralateral
Impression: deltoid ligament intact
- Forced dorsiflexion: No pain elicited
Impression: anterior tibiofibular ligament intact
- Twisting foot in the mortise: No pain elicited
Impression: anterior tibiofibular ligament intact
- Inversion stress test in anatomical position: Very slightly painful anterior to the lateral malleolus at end of range and no instability compared to contralateral
Impression: calcaneofibular ligament intact; mild pain likely emanating from the anterior talofibular ligament
- Inversion stress test in plantar flexion: Moderate pain that worsens at end of range of movement and questionable slight instability compared to contralateral

# First Aid and Initial Therapeutic Measures

# Clinical Guidelines for Ankle Injuries

The rules provide guidance for clinical personnel in determining when ankle injuries require radiography for suspected fracture and they are appropriate and effective for sport medicine settings Implementing the rules for sport ankle injuries prevented missed fractures decreased X-ray exposure saved unnecessary healthcare expenditures and fostered patient satisfaction The Ottawa Ankle Rules appear to be most useful when applied by healthcare workers as patients may not be able to apply them accurately to their own ankle injuries Sport rehabilitators and other allied health professionals should familiarize themselves with these important adjuncts to ankle injury evaluation

# Acute Ankle Injury: Information Collating and Decision Making

After executing the history inspection palpation and special testing steps the sport rehabilitator arrives at the clinical impression of grade 2 sprain of the anterior talofibular ligament Following is summary of the examination details that led to this decision:

- Mechanism of injury: inversion with plantar flexion movement that places the anterior talofibular ligament under tension
- Location of swelling and pain: anterior to the lateral malleolus which is the anatomical location of the anterior talofibular ligament
- Pain and slight laxity in the ankle: occurs during inversion and plantar flexion testing that place tension on the injured ligament suggesting that portion of the ligament is disrupted; note that in this case there is an equivocal impression when considering only the inversion exam with plantar flexion – the anterior drawer test result adds clinical information
- Associated fracture likelihood: not likely as the player arrived at the clinic with full weight bearing ambulation and palpation of the bony structures did not reveal pain; thus the Ottawa Ankle Rules suggest no fracture

Injury examination is very subjective although systematic evaluation scheme helps reduce variability in the assessment process Nonetheless there is no substitute for the experience of examining as many injuries as possible in order to gain the ability to discern subtleties present in the wide variety of cases Both proper clinical education and clinical experience are essential for effective injury care

# First Aid and Initial Therapeutic Measures

The acronym PRICE is the standard for acute care of sport injury This is reminder of five steps: application of Protection Rest Ice Compression and Elevation An alternative RICES – Rest Ice Compression Elevation Stabilisation – has been proposed but portrays the same basic meaning The generally accepted period for the acute treatment described below is the first 48–72 hours after the injury Acute care can be subdivided into three phases:

- Emergency: encompassing CPR or urgent transport to A&E
- Immediate: from time of injury to 12 hours post-injury
- Transition care: from 12 hours to 4 days post-injury

No matter how the initial period of time following an injury is apportioned the success of follow-up treatment depends substantially on the initial treatment that is applied

Protection by bracing splinting or non-weight bearing transport of an injured athlete is undertaken when necessary to minimize the risk of further trauma to an injured area Proper first aid techniques at this initial stage are crucial to the athlete’s well-being Rest from the activity that caused the injury or similar activities is warranted when the opportunity exists for reinjury or further injury

In the last several years the “gold standard” of cold – or cryotherapy – as an injury treatment has been analyzed for its efficacy in evidence-based practice In spite of questions raised about the therapeutic effects of cold treatment it is helpful for pain reduction Other reasons for applying cold to acute sport injuries include minimizing edema and effusion and controlling secondary cellular hypoxia and the broader secondary metabolic injury

# Management of Acute Sport Injury

# Management of Acute Sport Injury

Cold therapy is effective in managing acute sport injuries While cold slows oedema formation it does not reduce existing oedema (Knight and Draper 2008) A typical application of therapeutic cold should last no longer than 20 minutes (Bleakley et al 2006; Flegel 2008) with approximately one hour elapsing before another treatment to allow tissue rewarming Important considerations include:

- More tissue heat is lost with 10°C cold pack compared to 20°C cold pack (Knight and Draper 2008)
- Body regions with thinner insulating fat layer or larger surface area covered by the treatment modality experience greater heat loss (Knight and Draper 2008)
- Longer treatment times or more intense treatments can increase heat loss and risk tissue damage (Knight 1995; Knight and Draper 2008)
- Research indicates that muscular power and functional performance can be reduced even after 10-minute ice application (Fischer et al 2009)

Circumferential compression in an injured extremity enhances control of oedema by increasing external tissue pressure promoting lymphatic drainage and assisting venous return (Wilkerson 1991; Wilkerson and Horn-Kingery 1993; Delis et al 2000; Mora et al 2002; Vanscheidt et al 2009) Horseshoe-shaped pads cut from 1 cm (3/8 inch) foam or chiropody felt can be positioned underneath the bandage during wrapping to improve oedema elimination (Wilkerson and Horn-Kingery 1993; Merrick 2004)

Elevation of the injured extremity positioning the ankle above heart level is another technique that promotes decrease in swelling (Rucinkski et al 1991) Gravity assists venous return and lymphatic drainage of fluid collected in interstitial spaces (Dale et al 2004) However returning the limb to non-elevated position may reverse the oedema reduction gained by elevation (Tsang et al 2003) Therefore elevation should be maintained for as much time as possible during acute injury management

# Pain Management in Acute Musculoskeletal Sport Injury

A variety of therapeutic modalities are available for treating different aspects of sport injury This discussion will focus on those categorized as physical agents (Merrick 2007) or pharmacological agents designed to control pain

# Pain Management in Acute Musculoskeletal Sport Injury

# Physical Agents

The two traditional physical agents best suited for successful management of acute injury pain are cryotherapy and electrotherapy (Merrick 2004) There are many methods of cryotherapy (Swenson et al 1996; Bleakley et al 2004) though not all are equivalent in their efficacy (Bleakley et al 2004)

Cold treatment is effective for ameliorating pain among other therapeutic effects like slowing development of haematoma and oedema decreasing nerve conduction velocity reducing muscle spasm (Swenson et al 1996) reducing local blood flow in the injured area (Knight and Londeree 1980) and minimising secondary metabolic injury (Merrick et al 1999; Knight and Draper 2008)

# Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)

TENS is an electrotherapy modality shown to be effective for musculoskeletal pain (Hsueh et al 1997; Bertalanffy et al 2005) It electrically stimulates sensory nerves around an injured region to interfere with pain stimuli The gate control theory (Melzack and Wall 1965; Dickenson 2002) defines how high-frequency TENS mediates the sensation of pain Pain impulses on alpha-delta and C nerve fibres in the spinal cord are interrupted by sensory information transmitted via alpha-beta afferent nerves (Merrick 2004)

Thus if the TENS signal stimulates the alpha-beta fibres to great enough degree those nerve signals will close “gate” in the spinal cord for the pain stimuli and be perceived instead of the pain

Although TENS has been applied to acute musculoskeletal pain scenarios systematic review of the research is inconclusive about its efficacy (Walsh et al 2009) A lack of randomisation in clinical trials leads to over-estimation of the positive effects of the treatment (Carroll et al 1996) In acute low back pain patients therapeutic exercise with TENS was not assistive to patient recovery in comparison to exercise alone (Herman et al 1994) Neither was it beneficial for patients with acute postoperative pain following lumbar surgery (McCallum 1988)

However in randomised double-blind study of trauma patients at A&E TENS was as effective as oral medication for analgesia (Ordog 1987) There are several different TENS units on the market myriad of musculoskeletal injuries and numerous protocols with which TENS can be applied to these injuries Discussing all of these variations is beyond the scope of this chapter; but because TENS is relatively safe modality there is minimal risk to utilising it for management of acute pain in sport injuries and discontinuing it if it proves ineffective for given athlete

A simple ice bag is usually the most expeditious and inexpensive means of applying cold It has many proponents (McMaster et al 1978; Merrick 2004; Bleakley et al 2006; Knight and Draper 2008) although it has been shown that 20-minute cold whirlpool bath procured longer tissue temperature reduction than did 20-minute crushed ice pack treatment for the leg (Myrer et al 1998)

A protocol of 10-minute ice pack application 10 minutes without ice and then another 10 minutes of ice pack lowered tissue temperature better than single 20-minute ice pack treatment (Bleakley et al 2006) The effective cooling by ice is related to the phase change that it undergoes from solid to liquid as it melts (Merrick et al 2003)

The combination of therapeutic cold and exercise or cryokinetics (Hayden 1964; Knight 1995; Bleakley et al 2007; Knight and Draper 2008) is especially beneficial because of the way early motion promotes subsequent rehabilitation In this technique pain is managed by the cold treatment and then the athlete undertakes controlled exercise regimen followed by another cycle of cold

High-voltage low-frequency electrical stimulation can also be useful for managing acute pain (Merrick 2004) The intention for this modality is to elicit the release of an opioid substance called beta-endorphin that naturally occurs in the (Hughes et al 1984; Bender et al 2007); beta-endorphin is powerful mediator of pain (Bender et al 2007) The treatment may be somewhat uncomfortable to the patient because of the waveform and frequency but this stimulation is what makes the technique effective in bringing forth the release of beta-endorphin

# Management of Acute Sport Injury

# Electrotherapy for Acute Pain Management

A final type of electrotherapy that often is effective for acute pain management is interferential current (Merrick 2004; Jorge et al 2006) This technique’s name is derived from its two electromagnetic fields that cross each other; at their point of intersection is localized field of interference caused by their competing current phases The current in this field continually changes property that precludes accommodation by the nerves in the treatment area and which yields analgesia via the gate control mechanism (Merrick 2004) While interferential current has been shown to be similarly effective compared to TENS research about it is scant (Johnson and Tabasam 2003) Certainly its usage is confined to clinical setting perhaps making TENS preferable simply because of easier device portability and the ability of patients to operate the equipment

# Pharmacological Agents

# Topical Analgesics

Topical methods of analgesia are enjoying renewed interest in healthcare because of the challenges inherent with administering pain medications via other routes (Stanos 2007) Among the non-prescription compounds available counterirritants are one of the oldest and most widely used They are marketed under such brand names as Sports Muscle Rub Muellergesic BioFreeze Tiger Balm and Deep Heat Cream These preparations contain capsaicin menthol camphor garlic and other ingredients that possess both distinct aromatic properties and an ability to act on the nociceptors of the skin Their characteristic “counterirritation” reduces the perception of the musculoskeletal pain “irritation”

NSAID topical ointments especially those containing ibuprofen or diclofenac show promise as satisfactory alternatives to oral NSAIDs A double-blind study of the effects of oral versus topical gel ibuprofen reported no difference between the two delivery methods for all therapeutic measures (Whitefield et al 2002) Other studies corroborate the efficacy of topical NSAIDs (Dominkus et al 1996; Rovenský et al 2001; Banning 2008); but this depends on the relative depth (eg superficial versus intra-articular) of the pain’s origin (Dominkus et al 1996; Miyatake et al 2009)

# Over-the-Counter Oral Analgesics

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most widely used analgesic compound in the world (Jalan et al 2007) It is generally thought to be safe and effective medication (Graham et al 2003; Kehlet and Werner 2003) although some concern exists that liver toxicity is possible even at commonly used non-prescription doses (Jalan et al 2007) Paracetamol also has been shown to be as efficacious in acute musculoskeletal pain as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Woo et al 2005; Gøtzsche 2006) Nonetheless the drug is not without side effects and controversy (Moynihan 2002; Ahmad 2007); and assuredly it must not be offered nor ingested indiscriminately The sport rehabilitator has role and responsibility in properly advising athletes patients and clients in the approved use of this and other medicinal preparations

Compared to Paracetamol NSAIDs are much more likely to elicit unfavorable reactions They are well known for adversely affecting the gastrointestinal system (McCarthy 2001) and more recent evidence has associated adverse cardiovascular effects with cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor NSAIDs (Jüni et al 2004; Vardeny and Solomon 2008) Assessing the risks and benefits of this class of pharmaceuticals can be complex (Patrono and Rocca 2009) As mentioned above some studies suggest that for typical pain from acute musculoskeletal injury NSAIDs and Paracetamol are similarly effective Unquestionably administration of prescription NSAIDs or over-the-counter NSAIDs (eg ibuprofen) at prescription strength doses is unethical without the care of GP or consultant The sport rehabilitator must adhere to approved applications of NSAIDs and discourage improper NSAID use when advising individuals under their care

# Concussion

An understanding of concussion as an acute injury is crucial to the sport rehabilitator Whilst it is not the typical musculoskeletal injury it can be considerably more serious and troublesome to manage Concussion is defined as “ trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness” (American Academy of Neurology 1997 582) It has gained increasing attention in recent years because – in addition to its trauma-induced

The metabolic compromise of the brain (Katayama et al 1990; Giza and Hovda 2001) often leads to insidious sequelae associated with pathologies such as subdural hematoma (Kersey 1998; Mori et al 2006) or post-concussion syndrome (Fazio et al 2007; Yang et al 2009)

While the basic steps of acute injury evaluation apply to concussion this injury is treated separately due to its importance and the special techniques necessary for successful management Several medical associations have published position papers outlining proper management of concussion (American Academy of Neurology 1997; Guskiewicz et al 2004; American College of Sports Medicine 2006; McCrory et al 2009) to help decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with this injury The sport rehabilitator attending pitchside must be well-versed in the management of concussion and related conditions as catastrophic injury can be more alarming and potentially deadly than most other situations faced by sport medicine workers

Toth (2008) comprehensively reviewed the literature to identify neurological injury rates sustained in sport and recreation Collision sports (eg rugby North American football) sports with high-velocity movements (eg alpine skiing motorsports skateboarding cricket baseball ice hockey) and pugilistic sports (eg boxing martial arts) are particularly prone to head and neck injuries While protective headgear can help against direct blows in some sports they do not prevent all head injuries and concussions can occur with or without helmets (American College of Sports Medicine 2006) In football headgear does not protect against ball contact head injuries but appears to reduce the severity of head-to-head contact injuries (Withnall et al 2005) Rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head or high-velocity angular head motion are particularly consequential in sport-related brain injuries (Holbourn 1945; Ommaya and Gennarelli 1974) Concussions are usually graded 1 through 3 according to severity (American Academy of Neurology 1997; Randolph 2001)

Athletes who experience concussion can safely resume sport participation if they follow the appropriate return-to-play protocols

# Signs Observed by Medical Staff

- Appears to be dazed or stunned
- Is confused about assignment
- Forgets plays
- Is unsure of game score or opponent
- Moves clumsily
- Answers questions slowly
- Losess consciousness
- Shows behaviour or personality change
- Forgets events prior to play (retrograde)
- Forgets events after hit (post-traumatic)

# Symptoms Reported by Athlete

- Headache
- Nausea
- Balance problems or dizziness
- Double or fuzzy/blurry vision
- Sensitivity to light or noise
- Feeling sluggish or slowed down
- Feeling “foggy” or groggy
- Concentration or memory problems
- Change in sleep pattern (appears later)
- Feeling fatigued

Decisions regarding concussion management are carefully made by healthcare professionals using appropriate individualized clinical guidelines Evaluations are complex and evidence suggests that athletes who sustain multiple concussions exhibit cumulative neurological effects experience substantial reduction in memory ability and demonstrate several pitchside neurological examination abnormalities when compared to athletes with no history of concussion Moreover returning to participation prior to the resolution of head injury symptoms heightens susceptibility to further concussive episodes

Acute evaluation of concussion is challenging in the sport environment as the precipitating event may not be associated with direct head trauma or loss of consciousness Players may be anxious to return to play and may not report head injury or may attempt to evade examination A wide variety of signs and symptoms must be assessed and conservative management is paramount When in doubt the athlete should be excluded from participation until concussion is disproven or completely resolved due to the risk of cumulative neurological deficits

It is essential for sport rehabilitators and other healthcare professionals to maintain an emergency action plan for head-injured athletes Fundamental diagnostic signs to assess include consciousness airway integrity breathing and circulation In non-emergency episodes the sport rehabilitator should follow history inspection palpation and special testing paradigm modifying these as necessary based on the athlete's mental status

Features of ConcussionVacant stare (befuddled facial expression)Delayed verbal and motor responses (slow to answer questions or follow instructions)Confusion and inability to focus attention (easily distracted and unable to follow through with normal activities)Disorientation (walking in the wrong direction unaware of time date and place)Slurred or incoherent speech (making disjointed or incomprehensible statements)Gross observable incoordination (stumbling inability to walk tandem/straight line)Emotions out of proportion to circumstances (distraught crying for no apparent reason)Memory deficits (exhibited by the athlete repeatedly asking the same question that has already been answered or inability to memorise and recall 3 of 3 words or 3 of 3 objects in 5 minutes)Any period of loss of consciousness (paralytic coma unresponsiveness to arousal)

# Symptoms of Concussion

Early (minutes to hours):

- Headache
- Dizziness or vertigo
- Lack of awareness of surroundings
- Nausea or vomiting

Late (days to weeks):

- Persistent low grade headache
- Light-headedness
- Poor attention and concentration
- Memory dysfunction
- Easy fatigability
- Irritability and low frustration tolerance
- Intolerance of bright lights or difficulty focusing vision
- Intolerance of loud noises sometimes ringing in the ears
- Anxiety and/or depressed mood
- Sleep disturbance

# Evaluation and Cautions

Palpation is usually utilized to determine cranial or facial tenderness associated directly with the offending blow or muscular tenderness that results from reflexive contraction of the neck musculature when the head is struck There are important cautions for the sport rehabilitator when evaluating the athlete with closed head injury In his report of neuropsychological testing algorithms for suspected concussion in high school university and professional athletes Randolph (2001) identifies the increased sophistication necessary for each subsequent sport proficiency level because of the higher stakes for participants (eg stature salary importance of given competition) He offers model for neuropsychological evaluation that is customized for each level and also recommends baseline evaluations be collected from every player something which is clearly more feasible for professional clubs

# Concussion: History

The player denied loss of consciousness – which was corroborated by the medical staff who witnessed his collision and the events immediately subsequent – but he did report mild instance of “seeing stars” He was oriented to his surroundings and able to accurately relate the circumstances of the injury On questioning he indicated that his head felt “ little foggy” He was slightly disoriented and his vision was unfocused for few seconds These symptoms resolved in less than five minutes A mild headache was the player’s one enduring symptom

# Concussion: Inspection

The player’s pupils were of appropriate and equal size and responsive to light He did not exhibit any abnormal signs; otorrhea rhinorrhea and Battle’s sign were all absent No signs of serious injury were outwardly apparent

# Concussion: Palpation

The player’s skull cervical spine and neck musculature were systematically palpated for areas of point tenderness that could indicate pathology There was some tenderness in his right trapezius muscle along the neck but all other areas were non-tender

# Concussion: Special Testing

The player’s vital signs were within normal limits at baseline and continued so Evaluations of the cranial nerves were normal Ocular tracking was normal although the player mentioned needing to concentrate to complete the task His visual acuity was normal He completed the Romberg test for balance successfully with his eyes closed Motor coordination testing was normal The player’s neck soreness was accentuated slightly by active resistive muscle testing for right lateral flexion and hyperextension of the cervical spine

# Concussion Management

# Concussion: Information Collating and Decision Making

Based on the above described information that was gathered during the acute injury examination the player was diagnosed with mild grade 2 concussion This was due primarily to his descriptions of how he felt during and immediately following the injury Although his symptoms generally resolved quickly he continued to report headache that lasted beyond 15 minutes and slight neck musculature tenderness Thus the player was excluded from further participation pending complete symptom resolution The player’s headgear was collected in order to prevent an attempt to return to training without medical clearance The coach was informed that the player would be ineligible for participation until his symptoms subsided The player was instructed about the signs and symptoms of head injuries and their follow-up care and was dismissed with plan for his teammates to monitor him during the next 24 hours Specific directions about reporting new or worsening symptoms were provided and the medical staff made arrangements for his follow-up care

# Concussion: Follow-up for Return to Sport

The player presented himself to the sport medicine clinic on daily basis In close communication with the team physician the sport rehabilitator evaluated the player at each visit using standard concussion evaluation techniques A fortnight later the player’s headache was completely resolved and all other concussion tests were normal However he continued to exhibit mild myofascial neck pain with resisted cervical motions This was presumed to be residual sign of reflexive contraction of the neck musculature during the injury episode

At two weeks post-injury the player was referred to the radiology department for CT scan of his neck in order to investigate the persistent pain Review of the CT images revealed the player suffered from previously undetected congenital tripartite C1 vertebra On the basis of this finding the player was excluded from further participation in collision sports and counselled about alternative sporting outlets that would not expose his cervical spine to catastrophic risk It was obviously fortunate that during his preceding several years of North American football involvement he did not sustain disastrous neck injury This case exemplifies the need for alertness to symptoms that may be unrelated to the primary pathology A conservative approach is particularly appropriate for injuries to the central nervous system

# Conclusion

Acute management entails evaluation of the injury and application of appropriate treatments based on decisions informed by the evaluation’s results This process especially the evaluation is enhanced by the clinician’s presence at training sessions and competitions where they can witness the mechanism of injuries Following the injury evaluation and categorization of the injury’s nature and severity prompt administration of proper on-site care should ensue In non-emergent cases this will include judicious application of the PRICE method: protection rest ice compression and elevation

Success in managing the acute stage of injury generally leads to success in the post-acute stage and onward as the athlete is prepared by healthcare professionals and others on the sport healthcare team for re-entry to participation Insofar as possible it is incumbent on the sport rehabilitator to ensure this process goes smoothly to offer physical and psychological support and to keep the athlete’s best interests foremost during the progression back to full activity

# Musculoskeletal Assessment

# Julian Hatcher

# University of Salford Greater Manchester

# Clinical Assessment Procedures

A major skill that competent Sports Rehabilitator must have is the ability to assess conditions that are presented Needless to say these come in various clinical presentations In addition to this variety of signs and symptoms there are numerous ways of assessing these conditions and the various tests and questions to be asked are many Life can however be made little simpler by using the logical systems first advocated by the late Dr James Cyriax (Cyriax 1985a)

For many therapists particularly physiotherapists training in assessment has been based on conceptual foundations of renowned therapists such as Geoffrey Maitland (Maitland et al 2005) Although there are no problems with assessment methods based around Maitland’s philosophy there are some fundamental differences behind his philosophy and that of Cyriax These differences are based around the fact that Cyriax was physician; doctor whose job it was to make diagnosis in order to prescribe some treatment to the patient This was his role during the 1950s and 1960s

This is very different from Maitland who was an Australian physiotherapist had no clinical autonomy back in the 1970s the like of which therapists enjoy today; in fact he would provide treatments based on doctor’s diagnosis Maitland did however accept the fact that sometimes the diagnosis was not always accurate and his methods of assessment would at the very least attempt to identify whether or not the presenting condition was of musculoskeletal origin rather than some kind of systemic origin He could treat the former cases but would refer the latter cases back to the referring medic

Since both of these major assessment philosophies were introduced medical and therapeutic knowledge has advanced and both methods of assessment have adapted accordingly It is because of the strong emphasis in the original conceptual foundations that this chapter will concentrate on the fundamentals of assessment based on Cyriax philosophy It must be stressed however that this system of assessment has been adapted from his methods by both the author and by orthopaedic medicine clinical groups:

- Orthopaedic Medicine Seminars
- Society of Orthopaedic Medicine
- Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Orthopaedic Medicine

It is by no means meant to be definitive method of assessment; however it will help the manual therapist to reach diagnosis in over 90% of cases It must also be stated that this is only the basic assessment; there are many additional tests that can be added to the end of each of these assessments

# Musculoskeletal Assessment

# Musculoskeletal Assessment

This chapter has three main aims Firstly it aims to give sports rehabilitators the conceptual foundations of musculoskeletal assessment skills using logical system of questioning and physical testing in order to diagnose musculoskeletal disorders This will enable rehabilitators to assess and diagnose many of the common disorders that affect physically active people; more detailed assessment techniques and tests relevant to specific regions of the will be presented in the relevant chapters of this book Secondly this chapter aims to give simple but effective guideline for pitch-side assessment that can be utilised in most immediate clinical sporting scenarios Thirdly this chapter aims to provide framework for recording assessment and treatment details using commonly used system for recording medical notes of this kind The information within this chapter is designed to be an accompaniment to learning and is no substitute for the practical learning and role play that has been shown to significantly improve the diagnostic skills of practitioners (Smith et al 2005)

# Fundamentals of Assessment

Before progressing let us look at some fundamentals of assessment Firstly how useful are X-rays (radiographs) when it comes to assessment and diagnosis? From doctor’s perspective (certainly back in the 1950s) this was major method of assessing the musculoskeletal system Cyriax realised in his early professional career that there were many conditions where pain was present yet the radiographic findings were unequivocal

The problem with X-rays is that they only show dense tissues such as the bones All soft moving tissues are radio-translucent If pain arises from soft tissue then X-rays reveal only one of two things:

1 NAD – bones appear normal; that is negative X-ray or
2 X-ray shows some symptomless abnormality for example cervical spondylosis

In addition to this it often requires two radiographs in order to interpret meaningful information as an X-Ray is two-dimensional image of three-dimensional structure

# Physio Knowledge - Primary Decisions for Assessment

# Primary Decisions for Assessment

Again this sounds obvious but too often therapists have been guilty of performing treatments without really taking this into full consideration The aims of treatment therefore should be to influence the cause of symptoms not just relieve the symptoms

Only becomes truly apparent in the lateral view

Secondly how useful is palpation in assessment and diagnosis? There is always great temptation in assessing painful problems to go ahead and put finger to the sore area and palpate The problem here is that not all pain is felt at the site of origin; hence palpation can very often deceive Soft tissues have the habit of referring pain to other areas; often they refer pain on segmental basis Referred pain is not too confusing if following the simple “rules” that appear towards the end of this chapter

Following on from that it should be obvious that any treatment needs to be directed at the source of and not necessarily the site of symptoms There are however certain circumstances when the latter may be appropriate but it cannot be assumed to be enough For example client suffering with referred pain from tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) may require treatment to the source of the problem such as the bone-tendon junction but may also benefit from pain relieving modalities such as TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) In this case the treatment electrodes may be placed around the area of referred pain not just the causal site Treatment should have beneficial effect on the particular tissues

# Primary Decisions for Assessment

In the quest of diagnosis there are some primary decisions to be made even before the assessment can begin:

- About which joint does the lesion lie?
- In what sort of tissue does the lesion lie? Contractile/inert
- Is the pain reproduced by the test?

The first question should really be answered by the initial subjective history If the right sorts of questions are asked then an initial impression may become evident at least to the extent where the rehabilitator can decide at least which joint assessment to perform The next two questions are answered by applying the Cyriax principle of selective tissue tensioning (Cyriax 1985a) Each tissue is selectively stressed whilst at the same time not allowing any tension to occur at other tissues Tissues are conveniently divided into two tissue types:

1 Contractile: muscles tendons and all corresponding junctions (musculo-tendinous and teno-osseous junctions)
2 Inert: bones cartilage ligaments capsule bursae fasciae nerve root and dura mater

One of the inert structures above also displays an additional characteristic that is significant in diagnosis namely the joint’s fibrous capsule Cyriax observed that joints lost their range of motion in predictable ways which he termed Capsular Patterns:

When the capsule of joint becomes inflamed whether by trauma infection or degeneration it contracts and restricts the available range of movement in set pattern This pattern is the same for that joint but may be different for different joints for example:

Shoulders display the same Capsular Pattern as each other yet this differs from all knees

A loss of range that is not in common with the known Capsular Pattern is called Non-capsular Pattern

# Active Passive and Resisted Movements

Active movements are often not very helpful in diagnosis as all tissues are under tension simultaneously However they can give an indication of willingness to move in addition to the onset of pain available range and end-feel to joint motion

Passive movements stress the inert structures mainly and provide an indication of onset of pain range and end-feel Passive movements should be exactly that; movements where the client is relaxed and does not attempt to help or join in with the movement If this happens then the client would be recruiting the contractile tissues which may give false positive result

Resisted movements put the contractile components under tension and give an idea of pain and strength Resisted tests must be performed to the maximum and should be isometric contractions in order to ensure that the inert structures are not stressed at the same time In order to get maximum contraction the joint needs to be in relatively neutral position (to allow inert structures to be in non-stretched position) This should be mid-range in order to allow the angle of force from the contractile unit to act in the most mechanically advantageous position plus allows the optimum overlap between actin and myosin filaments for strong contraction

If only 90% strength is used and the muscle lesion lies within the untested 10% of fibers then false negative result would be obtained by the test Essentially it should be remembered that all tests whether passive or resisted are only as sensitive and specific as the rehabilitator is at performing them; there is no substitute for practicing assessment techniques

Finally it may be appropriate to use palpation in order to further localize the lesion Further additional tests may then be carried out to aid this process in some cases; this simple of assessment will allow the rehabilitator to gain good clinical understanding

 from normal hard end-feel in that it is not al-

 motion
a114 Empty – this is when no end-range is actually
 reached either due to the onset of extreme pain
 or because of major joint disruption (ie torn liga-
 ments/capsule) which therefore offer no resistance

Endhyphenfeels

The normal feel to the end of passive joint range of
motion is often called the end-feel The following
are classed as normal end-feels:
a114 Hard – usually due to bony opposition and feels
 like solid immoveable block to movement (eg
 olecranon process meeting the olecranon fossa
 during full elbow extension)
a114 Soft – usually due to soft-tissue opposition which
 feels like squashing of sponge (eg hamstrings
 meeting calf musculature during ﬂexion of the
 knee)
a114 Elastic – usually the most common end-feel for
 synovial joints and is associated with stretching of
 the joint capsule and the feeling of elastic recoil
 when releasing the tension (eg lateral rotation of
 the shoulder joint)
Abnormal end-feels or pathological end-feels as
they indicate the presence of pathology are as
follows:
a114 Springy – usually due to the presence of cartilage
 being trapped between joint surfaces and feels like
 ﬁrm resistance to movement that has some give
Referred pain
Referred pain is described as an error in perception;
pain perceived elsewhere than at its true site is termed
“referred” The sensation of pain is an extremely
complex phenomenon and very subjective however
certain aspects of pain perception are known (Butler
1991 2000)

 a114 site of pain – this is sensed by the in the
 sensory cortex of the brain
 a114 memory of pain – this is sensed in the temporal
 lobes of the brain
 a114 degree of pain – this is sensed in the frontal lobes
 (amount of tension in these frontal lobes may gov-
 ern the patient’s response to pain)

Referred pain although complex in nature can
be said to follow some general rules (Cyriax
1985a):

 a114 does not cross the mid-line of the 
 a114 has tendency to refer distally

 a114 always refers segmentally (within dermatome)
 a114 may be felt in all or part of dermatome

 a114 is often felt or perceived as being deep

# MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT

# Understanding Referred Pain

The use of simple rules can help to make some sense of referred pain:

- Usually the deeper the site of lesion the more vague the reference of pain and the greater the spread of reference
- This is also true of the location of the lesion; that is the more proximal the more vague and increase in spread of reference
- In most cases the stronger the stimulus the increase in spread of reference

# Clinical Orthopaedic Examination

The following subheadings make the whole clinical assessment easier to breakdown for the purpose of greater understanding Imagine the situation where an unknown client enters your clinic requiring your professional services After introducing yourself you need to sit down with the client and glean subjective history from them The subjective history is literally exploring what the client feels has happened to themselves and how it is affecting them now The objective examination which comes after allows the rehabilitator to perform series of objective tests – namely passive and resisted movements

The process of assessment is attempting to put together several pieces of puzzle and to stand back and look at these and attempt to recognise the puzzle; it is rare that assessment yields every piece so some sound anatomical knowledge and clinical reasoning skills will be needed for more complex patterns of clinical findings and it is this particular skill that is hardest to gain The rehabilitator looks for specific key elements (eg onset behaviour and symptoms etc) in much the same way that detective looks for key elements in any investigation (eg motive opportunity forensic evidence etc) Diagnosis is not therefore made on the basis of single positive finding but on pattern of clinical features

# Subjective Examination

# Observation

It is particularly important to gauge how much pain and discomfort the client is in; one of the most accurate ways of doing this is to observe their face when they walk in the clinic and when you greet them and introduce yourself to them At this point they are unaware that you may be observing them and will tend to act in more natural manner The face can give clear indications of pain whether severe or prolonged and may also give an idea of whether they have had disturbed sleep It is good opportunity to observe their posture also and the way they move and walk Someone with an ankle problem may walk on their heel with relatively fixed and extended knee whilst someone with knee problem may well walk on their toes in order to prevent full knee extension

# Subjective History

During the subjective history taking several questions need to be asked in order to help with the diagnostic process The order of questions is ultimately personal thing and does not have to follow the format set out below It is worth noting however that it is highly likely that as rehabilitator you are likely to not only ask someone to get relatively undressed but you are going to invade their “personal space” by actually physically handling their limbs or in some manner In which case it seems to me to be really important to gain some rapport with the client as quickly as possible and hence ask questions about themselves of more general (but no less important) nature early and follow up with the most personal questions towards the end of the subjective interview

It may also be helpful as an aide memoir to use the keywords listed below as template around which to ask relevant questions These are linked together as pairs:

- Age and occupation
- Site and spread
- Onset and duration
---
# Subjective Examination

# Subjective Examination

# Behaviour and Symptoms

It is important to determine if the symptoms being experienced are from referred source more proximal to the site of perceived pain

# Age

Establishing rapport begins with asking the client's age Some musculoskeletal conditions are age-related such as slipped epiphysis in young adolescent boys or degenerative conditions in individuals over 50

# Occupation

Understanding the client's occupation is crucial Are they professional athlete or recreational athlete? This information helps in establishing the activity levels they need to regain as part of the treatment plan A professional athlete may require more rehabilitation than an office worker who plays tennis occasionally Additionally it is important to determine if work or recreational activities may have impacted the current injury either causatively or in terms of recovery

# Site

Asking the client to indicate where they feel their problem is can provide insights into whether the issue is local or referred from elsewhere in the Understanding the rules of referred pain can help differentiate between local pathology and referred sensations

# Spread

Linked to the site of pain or symptoms is the concept of spread It is important to ask the client if their pain remains localized or if it moves in any way Knowledge of referred pain can further inform this assessment

# Onset

Identifying the factors that led to the onset of the client's problem is useful There are generally three forms of onset: gradual sudden and insidious Sudden onsets are usually associated with trauma while gradual onsets may result from overuse or repeated trauma (eg tendonitis) Insidious onsets may indicate more severe or sinister pathologies such as tumors or systemic issues like gout

# Duration

The duration of the condition provides insight into the likelihood of changing the client's symptoms Generally the longer someone has condition the less likely it is that significant changes can be made However it is still important to attempt to address the issue as the client may be seeing therapist for the first time or may receive an accurate diagnosis

# Behaviour

It is essential to understand how the symptoms change throughout the day Are they constant? What aggravates or eases them? Is there any diurnal variation? For instance conditions affecting the capsule and ligaments may feel stiff after prolonged static periods but improve with movement Tendonitis often worsens during or after activity while muscle lesions may cause pain during specific movements that recruit the affected muscle

# Symptoms

The most obvious symptom here is pain; however some clients complain of other sensations such as locking giving way pins and needles (paraesthesia) and even numbness (anaesthesia) They may also complain of stiffness (as symptom as opposed to lack of range of motion – which you would measure as an objective sign) There are many authors who have written about pain and the types of pain that people experience and relate this to the various types of tissue that give pain (Butler 1991 2000; Travell and Simons 1992; Simons et al 1999)

The fact that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind pain and its perception is so complex is further complicated when psychological influences are included (Butler 2000) This makes clinical reasoning of pain become rather subjective and may lead to many opportunities for misunderstanding For example clients have described the pain of sciatica as “being like red-hot poker down the back of my leg” or sharp knee pain “feeling like I have been stabbed” As both the client and the rehabilitator need to fully understand what is meant by such descriptions either or both may misinterpret what is really being experienced and diagnosis based on such reasoning may be flawed It would seem to suffice therefore when client claims they have pain; objective and subjective examination will indicate the rest!

# Previous Medical History

Many therapists like to ask questions around this subject earlier in the interview; however this may result in digging up matter that is really quite personal so leaving it to the end allows you first to establish rapport with your client Again there are many things to consider here; ideally keep it reasonably simple Several forms of treatment are contraindicated by the presence of certain conditions and there are too many to consider at this stage of assessment (as you have no idea what treatments you wish to perform at this stage)

Therefore ask the client whether they have had any previous major operations accidents or illnesses The common response to this is glib “No” It is useful to check and ask “Are you sure?” This has the purpose of just getting the client to realize that this is an important question that requires careful consideration This may well yield the same response; however you are more likely to be able to trust this response in terms of accuracy

A good example of the reason for asking such questions is this: female client complains of low back pain of insidious gradual nature and in her past history reveals she has had hysterectomy What needs to be established is why did she have hysterectomy (was it due to cervical cancer – which can lead to spinal secondary metastases)? This can be ascertained by asking whether the client is still under the medical team for this or has she been discharged (ie clear of the condition) This may help to change the potential worrying diagnoses of spinal cancer to one of remote possibility (note it does not dismiss the possibility)

# Medication

Linked closely to past medical history is the question of medication It may be useful to see if the client is taking any medication for the current condition and whether or not it is beneficial However it is also another way of establishing whether there are any other underlying illnesses or diseases not disclosed in the previous questions As there are plethora of possible medications that clients use we are particularly on the lookout for anticoagulants and long-term corticosteroid use

This is because in the case of the latter ligaments and joints may become damaged by such medication; in the case of the former medication potentially violent or high-impact treatment/rehabilitation processes may potentially cause bleeding that is not easy to stop (Grieve 1991)

# Objective Examination

The next stage is the beginning of the objective examination and should begin with general inspection of the affected area
---
 OBJECTIVE EXAMINATION 193

 Inspection
 This is an opportunity to inspect the site of lesion
 brieﬂy looking for evidence of the following:

 a114 bony deformity
 a114 colour changes
 a114 wasting
 a114 swelling

Bony deformity could indicate joint subluxation dis-
location fracture or postural changes whilst colour
changes may indicate presence of bleeding or signs
of inﬂammation Musculature associated with the
site of lesion may indicate the presence of long-
standing problems or even neurological problems
Swelling would indicate the presence of an inﬂam-
matory process Figure 118 shows discrepancy in
the relative scapula position from left to right

Figure 11period9 Palpation for heat

 This is followed up by an initial brief palpation of
the area (see Figure 119) speciﬁcally looking for:
 a114 heat – indicating presence of inﬂammation

 a114 swelling – indicating presence of inﬂammation
 a114 synovial thickening – indicating presence of long
 standing inﬂammation
 a114 pulses – indicating blood ﬂow to through the area
It is only once this initial observation phase is com-
plete that the actual objective testing and measure-
ment should begin It is always necessary to establish
whether the client feels any symptoms whilst at rest
before beginning any testing

 Objective testing and measurement
 a114 active movements (if appropriate) for willingness
 to move
 a114 passive movements for pain range and end-feel
 (passive stretching/squeezing may occur to inert
 tissues)
 a114 resisted movements for pain and power (isometric
 contraction of contractile tissue components with-
 out passive stretching)

 The number and variety of these tests will be speciﬁc

# MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT

Dealt with in subsequent specific chapters relevant to that region It may be appropriate to include some neurological tests such as testing of reflexes strength tests for myotomes and sensation loss for dermatomes particularly in spinal assessments where nerve roots may be involved in the lesion It is only after completion of all these tests would palpation be performed to localize the lesion further and in some more difficult conditions further additional tests may be performed such as X-rays scans blood tests etc

# Emergency Pitchside Assessment

This is all very well for the clinic scenario when the “walking wounded” literally walk into the clinic; but what happens on the pitch side poolside or trackside?

Look at the specific limb Be vigilant for obvious signs for example bleeding discoloration/bruising immediate swelling bone/joint deformity muscle spasm

- L: LOOK at the specific limb
- T: TOUCH the injury site only if the athlete will let you Palpate gently to find the site of pain – note the athlete’s response
- A: ACTIVE movement: can the athlete move the limb painlessly through the full range of movement?
- P: PASSIVE movement: Only if ‘A’ above applies attempt to move the joint to the end of its range and note the response
- S: STAND-UP and play-on: Can the player resume immediately or are they trying to ‘run-it-off’?

Obviously this approach does not give an accurate diagnosis but allows quick and easy method for assessing the situation in front of you and later you can apply the more in-depth approach to diagnosing any remaining problem in more controlled conditions

# Assessment and Evaluation Notation

Generally speaking there are specific programmes of study that must be completed before entering this situation for many professional sports in the UK (Soccer Rugby Union and Rugby League) Rehabilitators must ensure that records are retained or destroyed in accordance with Department of Health Records Management (NHS Code of Practice – part 2) In other parts of the world this may be different (and certainly may be different within different States within the US)

By UK Law all records should be retained for eight years following conclusion of treatment The only exceptions to this are for children whose notes must be retained until the client reaches their 25th birthday That said there are different ways of recording notes and there are no such rules as to how this should be done; however notes must be recorded accurately to comply with regulations within the country of work

- S: STOP play If the player has gone down injured get there as quickly as you can
- A: ASK the player (unless unconscious) what happened Remember as detailed history as possible will be important

The SOAP format is divided into four sections:

- Subjective History
- Objective Examination
- Assessment and Analysis
- Plan

# Details of Each Section

The subjective records information regarding age and occupation site and spread onset and duration behaviour and symptoms and past medical history The objective records evidence of deformity colour changes wasting swelling heat and findings from objective passive and resistive tests Recordings of the outcome of any special tests used would also be recorded here It is always worth reporting negative outcomes to tests to show that they have been performed; however highlight in some way all the highly significant findings from the subjective and objective examination as this allows one to quickly identify the salient points when reviewing the same client in the future

The assessment allows the rehabilitator to consider the diagnosis (or diagnoses in the case of multiple problems) and attempt to identify the status of the client and the probable prognosis Indications of the severity and irritability would be useful here too It may also be appropriate to consider short-term and long-term aims of treatment For example an athlete with an acutely sprained ankle may require taping or strapping and swelling control as short-term goals whilst requiring gait re-education proprioception and sport-specific training as long-term goals By creating clear intention of how and why to treat the rehabilitator can quickly review their aims of treatment Together with the previously highlighted findings from the subjective and objective assessment this allows the rehabilitator to establish treatment plan that is logical and effective This plan should also consider how often the client should receive treatment the frequency and intensity of any exercise or training programme given for home (self-administered) use and would also be useful to record any criteria for discharge

An example of notes recorded from particular client is given in Figure 1110 Additional information would normally need to be included here (eg name date of birth name and contact details of GP); however these have been omitted here for the sake of confidentiality It may be pertinent at this point to remind rehabilitators that it is unethical and breach of professional conduct to disclose information regarding client to anyone other than another medical or paramedical practitioner and as such all records of assessments and treatments should be securely filed away in order to ensure anonymity and confidentiality at all times

# Background

Rehabilitation is complex process demanding the attention and knowledge of range of issues and applications Successful rehabilitation of sports injuries is dependent on progressive plan that addresses and accommodates the injury/pathological issues and conditions In so doing the rehabilitation plan incorporates multitude of decisions and actions often underpinned by research evidence

This chapter will explore these issues in relation to progressive rehabilitation by examining the concepts and principles of sports rehabilitation The main issue and consideration specific to the development of progressive rehabilitation plan is the careful and logical inclusion of objective criteria These criteria allow the practitioner to consider how and when to either progress or regress the rehabilitation in relation to the athlete’s needs and goals

Figure 121 details the components for progressive rehabilitation planning by considering questions necessary for the successful development of the rehabilitation programme and the logical sequencing of the progressive rehabilitation exercise regime

# Understanding Progressive Rehabilitation Assessment and Observation

On initial observation of an injury it is essential to perform an injury screening (refer to Chapter 2 for detailed overview of screening procedures) SINS (severity irritability nature and stage) and SOAP notes (subjective objective assessment and plan) are two acronyms that provide an effective method of gathering information relating to possible trauma (Sleszynski et al 1999)

**Table 121: Notation and Use of SINS and SOAP**
|Acronym|Description|
|---|---|
|SINS|Severity Irritability Nature Stage|
|SOAP|Subjective Objective Assessment Plan|

Components of rehabilitation including flexibility the restoration of muscular strength and endurance and enhancing proprioceptive control are concepts that must be managed effectively to ensure optimal injury management (Beam 2002) within the context of physical activity and return to sport Systematic functional and progressive rehabilitation involves the process of carefully considering the key components of musculoskeletal trauma This involves adequate management of the injury in order to prevent further soft tissue trauma and enable progressive treatment protocol to be implemented effectively

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

Is the athlete able to meet if not exceed the loads and forces placed on the injured area specific to that of the sport they will participate in?

# Key Considerations

- Has the healing process been reached and is the athlete able to tolerate the pain?
- Has the athlete established adequate range of motion (ROM) and flexibility to perform their sport effectively and efficiently without reinjuring?
- Has the athlete been able to “reboot/relearn” how to use the injured area with sufficient functional and dynamic control?
- Is the injured area able to deal with reactive internal and external forces specific to the sport played?

# Strength and Power

Goal planning is key to the successful implementation of progressive rehabilitation programme For example if an athlete has excessive valgus movement of the knee during single leg functional activity it is the role of the rehabilitator to provide effective stabilisation and strengthening exercises for the gluteal muscles in order to provide the lumbo-pelvic hip complex with the stability it requires to maximise total power output throughout the entire kinetic chain (Liebenson 2006; Boudreau et al 2009)

However during the rehabilitative process it is imperative to ensure strengthening is not focused solely on specific muscle as during closed kinetic chain exercises which simulate functional activities the entire kinetic chain must be considered

- Continual Rehabilitation
- Exercise Progressions
- Functional Training/Sports Specific
- Use of Treatment Modalities

It is inaccurate to make judgments stating specific muscle is responsible for poor neuromuscular control Previous research linked to isokinetic muscle testing which isolates target muscle has stated hip musculature is responsible for optimal functional single leg activity; however fatigue does not occur in single muscle group when performing closed kinetic chain exercises which simulate movement patterns more likely to be carried out during everyday activities and athletic performance (Reimer and Wikstrom 2009)

Similarly deficits in muscular strength have been shown to increase the risk of injury Hollman et al (2006) suggest that reduced isometric strength of the hip abductors in relation to the hip adductors is associated with malalignment of the lower extremity such as foot pronation and knee valgus This may result in inadequate neuromuscular control during functional movement increasing the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) (Hewett et al 2006)

Therefore when prescribing exercises during the rehabilitation of an athlete it is important to take into account not only strengthening of the affected region of the but also to continue strengthening the entire extremity which can prevent muscle imbalances and potential injury concerns

It is the synthesis of knowledge coupled with clinical practice that best defines how and when to either progress or regress exercise patterns and routines It would be useful to read the chapters on Clinical Reasoning (Chapter 16) and An Introduction to Periodisation (Chapter 9) along with this chapter to better aid understanding of exercise design and decision-making processes

Consideration and application of the concept of continual progression is useful as it provides the clinician with the ability to justify why specific exercises have been prescribed and how best to regress or progress the exercises depending on the athlete’s development through the rehabilitation process During the final stages of rehabilitation programme it is important that the athlete performs exercises within their functional range this involves performing exercises that initiate abnormal motor control and allow minimal mechanical sensitivity (Liebenson 2006)

By ensuring exercises are performed within functional range this limits the possibility of re-injury (Stracciolini et al 2007) In addition to introducing the athlete to functional exercise it is important to ensure that movements simulate the patterns of movement the athlete will eventually perform in their sport this needs to include the relevant muscle actions (concentric eccentric isometric) velocity of movement force generation power output and rate of force development

Muscle actions that relate to effective movement patterns in the athlete’s sport must be implemented during final stages of rehabilitation For example the hamstring muscle complex is commonly injured region of the in relation to sports injury (Brockett et al 2004; Hoskins and Pollard 2005; Askling et al 2006; Verrall et al 2006) It is important however to

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

It is important not to generalise when assessing and initiating injury management for the hamstring muscle complex The demands of various sports often lead to trauma developing in different regions of the hamstring complex For instance in sprinters injury consistently occurs in the long head of the biceps femoris; in contrast dancers suffer common trauma at the proximal tendon of the semimembranosus Return to pre-injury level was shown to be shorter for high-speed trauma experienced by sprinters in contrast to trauma resulting from overstretching as demonstrated by the dance group (Askling et al 2008) This evidence indicates that rehabilitation from hamstring trauma should consider both the type of sport in which the athlete participates and the common movement patterns in preparation for implementing sports-specific functional rehabilitation programme designed to prevent re-injury This protocol should apply directly to any injury to ensure successful management and long-term protection against chronic and ongoing injury concerns

# Inflammation and Pain Management

Liebenson (2006) found that the application of an early-stage rehabilitation programme with restoring full pain-free functional range of motion as main objective is beneficial and can result in rapid attainment of pre-set functional tasks The following details how cryotherapy can be used in the acute management of soft tissue injuries

**Cryotherapy Protocol for Acute Soft Tissue Injuries**
|Application|Duration|Temperature|
|---|---|---|
|Ice/water submersion|10 minutes on|Approx 0°C|
|Room temperature|10 minutes off| |
|Ice/water submersion|10 minutes on|Approx 0°C|

MacAuley (2001) and Bleakly et al (2006) suggest that intermittent application of ice may enhance the therapeutic effect of ice in pain relief after acute soft tissue injury The sport rehabilitator is advised to adhere to prescribed guidelines for the use of cryotherapy within progressive injury rehabilitation These guidelines include the responsible use of cryotherapy to prevent ice burns that may be caused by direct application or prolonged exposure The use of wet cotton towel similar to that of dish cloth may act as suitable barrier between ice and skin (Bleakly et al 2007) Early intervention with cryotherapy has also been suggested to help speed recovery and return to sport (Hubbard and Denegar 2004) highlighting the importance of early cryotherapy use within injury management

According to Hubbard and Denegar (2004) this field of applied study and practice would benefit from evidence-based research into the use and barriers of cryotherapy application Collins (2008) further supports this claiming that the evidence behind cryotherapy is insufficient to improve the outcomes of clinical management of soft tissue injuries

# Range of Motion and Flexibility

Range of motion (ROM) and flexibility are central to rehabilitation and are used not only as markers of assessment but also as techniques for rehabilitation practices (Small et al 2008) ROM testing is an essential component of athlete evaluation and provides the practitioner with information including active and passive ROM contractile ability of the musculature and occasionally severity of injury (Stracciolini et al 2007) This information can then be used to develop specific stretching programme aimed at enabling the athlete to restore full ROM allowing progression through appropriate rehabilitative exercises and eventually returning to full sports participation (Beam 2002)

It is important to ensure that prior to progressing rehabilitative exercises and returning to sport the athlete has sufficient ROM at the joint to enable full capacity of movement to perform the exercises and sport-specific movements The athlete must have pain-free active ROM in the frontal sagittal and transverse planes when performing basic movements and have the ability to contract the affected muscle in synergy with the antagonist muscles (Liebenson 2006) Only after an athlete can carry out these movements can sport-specific functional rehabilitation programme be implemented (Small et al 2008)

During an initial musculoskeletal evaluation the clinician may have to take the athlete through active and passive range of motion Active range of motion is when the athlete moves the affected joint through its range without any external influence This is done as measure of pain through functional range and also provides the sports rehabilitator with the necessary information

# Range of Motion and Flexibility

# Range of Motion and Flexibility

Information about whether to perform passive range of motion assessment at that joint (Jarvinen et al 2007) Passive range of motion occurs when the clinician takes the affected limb through its range in order to provide information regarding the integrity of the joint or ‘end feel’ This usually provides important information regarding the client’s condition and informs the clinician about future action assessment and intervention

In considering normal joint range of motion resultant injury risk factors and how to relate the importance of full functional range of motion to the athlete’s movement patterns in their sport the clinician can appreciate the relationship between the latter stages of the rehabilitation process and the return of an athlete to competitive environment (Pizzari et al 2008) The athlete should not return to full activity until full pain-free functional range has been established (Stracciolini et al 2007)

As flexibility is an expression of range of motion knowing when and how to incorporate flexibility training into range of motion rehabilitation is important The clinician must also be able to determine the effectiveness of flexibility training in relation to final stage rehabilitation and the athlete’s sport It is more beneficial to fully and accurately assess movement dynamics in relation to the common muscular movement patterns and then decide whether or not increased range of motion is beneficial to improving the performance of that athlete (Jarvinen et al 2007)

# Flexibility Training

The aim of flexibility programme should be to achieve and maintain an optimum range of motion (ROM) at each joint that is specific to the athlete's sport

Three modalities that are universally employed during flexibility programme to obtain an increase in joint ROM are:

- Static stretching
- Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) (Roberts and Wilson 1999; Babault et al 2009)
- Self myofascial release (SMR) (Curran et al 2009)

# Static Stretching

Static stretching involves taking the limb to position that produces increases in muscular tension and allows elongation of muscle with the aim of enhancing tissue extensibility The proposed neurophysiological process by which this occurs is termed autogenic inhibition (Olivo and Magee 2006) This is performed in slow and controlled manner (consequently the possibility of exciting the muscle spindles and inducing stretch reflex is minimal) and held for at least 30 seconds (Bacurau et al 2009; Yuktasir and Kaya 2009) and repeated 3–4 times (Costa et al 2009; Yuktasir and Kaya 2009)

As result of the prolonged period under increased muscular tension the golgi tendon organs (GTOs) may be stimulated and allow for autogenic inhibition to occur thereby resulting in decrease in tension and therefore lengthening of the agonist which enables prolonged and increased stretch of the muscles (Olivo and Magee 2006)

To initiate the stretch follow these guidelines:

1 Facing wall place hands out in front of the 
2 Place one foot in front of the other ensuring heels stay in contact with the ground
3 Maintaining an upright posture push forwards from the hips keeping the head upright and facing forwards until stretch is felt in the gastrocnemius of the back leg

Passive stretching (at the end of available range) should be avoided for the first 72 hours as minimal period and possibly for the first 7–10 days following injury if more severe (Neidlinger-Wilke et al 2002)
---
# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

The reasons for this is that healing tissue is weak and intolerant to tensile loading and is likely to be damaged by uncontrolled stretching Prior to the 10th day post injury it would be more appropriate to take the muscle through its full available pain-free range without any attempt to force the muscle beyond this point

Once it is appropriate to begin stretching the muscle that is elongating the tissue beyond its available range then careful passive stretching can be performed Each stretch should be held at the end of available range within the limits of pain Time frequency duration and intensity of stretch remain debatable in the literature Some research suggests passive stretching should be held for minimum of 15 seconds with 6–8 sets per day (Roberts and Wilson 1999) However Bandy et al (1994 1997) reviewed stretches at 15 seconds 30 seconds and 60 seconds They determined that 30 seconds was the optimum duration (ideally repeated 3 times and performed 3 times per day) also stating that longer periods after 30 seconds were ineffective in promoting additional stretch

As with strengthening exercises stretching exercises need to be progressed in order that the tissue adapts to the different types of load once the athlete is comfortable (pain-free) with passive stretching (Bandy et al 1994 1997)

Although implementing stretching protocol may elicit improvements in performance as result of increased range of motion (ROM) at joint (Herda et al 2008) research has suggested the use of static stretching may have detrimental effect on performance immediately post stretching in relation to sprinting strength endurance and jumping all power-based activities (Bacurau et al 2009; O’Sullivan et al 2009; Hough et al 2009) PNF has also been linked to decrease in power production immediately post stretching (Marek et al 2005) Therefore it is essential that ROM is restored as early in the rehabilitation process as possible to ensure that this does not have detrimental effect on subsequent strength or power performance

# PNF Techniques

There are two main PNF techniques: contract-relax and contract-relax-antagonist contract techniques (Olivo and Magee 2006)

The contract-relax method requires limb to be moved into stretched position and then the agonist undergoes an isometric contraction for 7–10 seconds As the limb does not move but the muscle contracts and therefore shortens the change in length is accommodated by lengthening of the tendons This lengthening of the tendon stimulates the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) and thereby inhibits the agonist Once the isometric contraction ends the ROM can be increased and the procedure repeated

The contract-relax-antagonist contract technique has been suggested as the most effective in increasing muscle length due to the concept of reciprocal inhibition which produces increased suppression of the motor pool (Etnyre and Abraham 1986) Reciprocal inhibition is the relaxation that occurs in the opposing muscle that is experiencing increased muscular tension (Olivo and Magee 2006) This is performed with voluntary isometric contraction of the desired muscle to be stretched lasting approximately 7–10 seconds at range of 25–40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) followed by an antagonist-assisted static stretch phase (Olivo and Magee 2006; Smith and Fryer 2008) The incorporation of passive stretch supported by the antagonist is believed to produce greater joint flexibility than static stretching (Sady et al 1982; Guissard 1988; Magnusson et al 1996; Handel et al 1997) and produce the longest duration of maintained flexibility than any other of stretching (Spernoga 2001)

# Isometric Contraction Process

1 The leg is taken to the initial tissue barrier with the opposing leg straight along the floor Ensure your hand position is not over the joint
2 Hold for an initial period stretching the raised leg
3 Induce an isometric contraction from the athlete in the hamstring musculature
4 Rest the hamstring muscles and induce an isometric contraction of the antagonist muscles (quadriceps)
5 Rest and repeat the process
6 Follow the guidelines as stated above for advised muscle contraction force and length of time contractions should be held

# Self Myofascial Release (SMR)

Self myofascial release (SMR) is soft tissue technique centered on enhancing range of motion (ROM) through the breakdown of myofascial restrictions in the ’s fascial system (Curran et al 2009) Fascia is three-dimensional web of connective tissue that envelopes the ’s soft tissue from head to toe providing stability and flexibility (Barnes 1997; Myers 1997)

SMR is performed by slowly applying force with the use of foam roller to tender spots of the muscle (Curran et al 2009) which are indicative of fascially restricted areas termed “trigger points” (Travell and Simons 1992; Simons et al 1998) The force is maintained for time period ranging from 20 to 90 seconds or until significant reduction in discomfort is attained This encourages the transformation of ‘knotted’ hypertoned bundle of fibrous tissue to more pliable tissue that is parallel in formation to the fascia (Travell and Simons 1992; Simons et al 1998)

The subsequent increased ROM achieved using SMR has been attributed to the neurophysiological effects on the fascia (Johansson 1962; Schleip 2003) and histological changes in the fascia's cellular content (Cantu and Grodin 2001; Sefton 2004; Barnes 2005)

When attempting to enhance ROM at joint with flexibility training it is important to not only address the muscles that are displaying reduced extensibility but also the synergistic muscles that are underactive or weak and therefore reducing active ROM In this case strengthening at the ends of the ROM is required

# Proprioception and Neuromuscular Control

As suggested by Myer et al (2005) neuromuscular control training is important for improvements in athletic performance and biomechanical stability which in turn reduces the risk of injury

Proprioception is term used frequently during rehabilitation and can be defined as specialized variation of the sensory system of touch that encompasses the sensation of joint movement (kinesthesia) and joint position (joint position sense) (Lephart et al 1997) These signals are transmitted to the spinal cord via afferent (sensory) pathways (Prentice 2004) The term refers specifically to conscious and subconscious appreciation of joint position in space The efferent (motor) response to sensory information is termed neuromuscular control (Jonsson et al 1989)

Two motor control mechanisms are involved with interpreting afferent information and coordinating efferent responses (Dunn et al 1986; Prentice 2004): feed-forward and feedback

Feed-forward neuromuscular control involves planning movements based on sensory information from past experience (La Coix 1981; Dunn et al 1986) The feedback process continuously regulates muscle activity through reflex pathways Feed-forward mechanisms are for preparatory muscle activity; feedback processes are associated with reactive muscle activity The level of muscle activation whether it is preparatory or reactive greatly modifies its stiffness properties (Prentice 2004)

From mechanical perspective muscle stiffness is the ratio of the change in force to the change in length (Dietz et al 1981; Bach et al 1983; Dyhre-Poulsen et al 1991) Muscles that are stiffer resist stretching more effectively and provide more effective dynamic restraint to joint displacement (Bach et al 1983; McNair et al 1992); for example in an ACL deficient knee the increase in hamstring muscle activation increases hamstring stiffness and therefore the functional ability of the knee to reduce anterior translation (Bach et al 1983; McNair et al 1992; Myer et al 2005)

The dynamic restraint system is mediated by specialized nerve endings called mechanoreceptors (Grigg 1994) which function by transducing mechanical deformation of tissue into modulated neural signals (Grigg 1994)
---
# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

Increase tissue deformation is coded by increase afferent discharge rate or increase in mechanoreceptors activated (Grigg 1994; Prentice 2004) The signals provide sensory information concerning internal and external forces acting on joint Mechanoreceptors (Pacinian corpuscles Meissner corpuscles and free nerve endings) can be classified as either quick adapting (QA) or slow adapting (SA) Quick adapting receptors cease discharging shortly after the onset of stimulus whereas SA continue to discharge as long as the stimulus is present (Clark and Burgess 1975; Schultz et al 1984; Katonis et al 1991; Grigg 1994)

In healthy joint these QA mechanoreceptors are believed to provide conscious and subconscious kinaesthetic sensation in response to joint movement or acceleration whilst SA mechanoreceptors provide continuous feedback (Freeman and Wyke 1966; Clark and Burgess 1975) and therefore proprioceptive information relative to the joint position (Freeman and Wyke 1966; Clark and Burgess 1975; Schultz et al 1984; Katonis et al 1991; Grigg 1994)

The pre-activation theory suggests that prior sensory feedback (experience) concerning the task is utilized to pre-programme muscle activity patterns Rehabilitation programmes should be designed to include proprioceptive component that addresses the following three levels of motor control: spinal reflexes cognitive programming and brainstem activity Such programme is highly recommended to promote dynamic joint and functional stability (Lephart et al 1997) There are different proprioceptive states that are important to consider in the design of progressive rehabilitation programme

Static proprioceptive development involves exercises with the maintenance of stable base while allowing for only minimal movement During this stage of neuromuscular development the athlete should focus on control of posture and be able to perform number of modifications of static proprioceptive training before progressing on to dynamic more functional proprioceptive training programme (Liebenson 2006)

Dynamic proprioceptive training should only be introduced when the athlete has demonstrated sufficient level of balance and coordination during the static proprioceptive exercise phase of the neuromuscular control program (Beam 2002) Since dynamic proprioceptive exercises involve greater levels of instability and require higher demand for accuracy strength and speed of motion (Myer et al 2006) balance and coordination are important to ensure the athlete can progress safely without hindering their development A simple objective test to determine the athlete’s progression from static to dynamic exercises can include the Romberg test which assesses the ability to balance The athlete stands with their feet together and eyes closed (Thuan-Lee and Kapoula 2007) A more advanced test is the stork stand which involves the athlete standing on one leg usually the affected limb and maintaining the position for period of at least 30 seconds without touching the floor with the opposing leg or supporting themselves with their other limbs (Melorose et al 2007) This can then be progressed by being performed with eyes shut If the athlete finds these tests demanding and cannot perform them effectively there is deficit in balance that needs to be addressed before progressing onto dynamic exercises

# Proprioception and Neuromuscular Control

Proprioceptive responses and neural drive to the working muscles aid in the athlete’s development This example can be implemented as soon as the athlete is able to weight bear on both legs Once this capability is obtained the exercises including taking the individual from standing position to countermovement jump can be progressed or regressed depending on the ability of the athlete to perform each exercise without excessive biomechanical dysfunction

Continual adaptation to sports specific functional balance training is fundamental to enhancing an athlete’s proprioceptive awareness As result of proprioceptive training receptors in soft tissue structures and joint complexes are trained to perform coherent actions able to initiate dynamic functional movements (Komi 2003)

Dynamic proprioceptive exercises are performed to enhance the ability of the muscles around the affected joint to control joint motion and stabilize the during movements in multi-planar directions (Myer et al 2006; Stracciolini et al 2007; Pasanen et al 2008; Subasi et al 2008) When an athlete is performing dynamic neuromuscular control exercises to high level it is the practitioner who must continue to progress the exercises in terms of either intensity or difficulty as required in order to prevent plateau development

For further reading and applied examples regarding specific neuromuscular rehabilitation for selected joints refer to the chapters on the knee (Chapter 21) and ankle (Chapter 22) in the latter of this book

By continuing to enhance the athlete's neuromuscular development the clinician is allowing for adaptive changes to occur within the neuromuscular system This can lead to increases in the ability of an athlete to perform plyometric based exercises increased levels of balance and improved leg coordination in sprint drills (Cameron et al 2007) Therefore appropriate progressions during neuromuscular control training will prepare the athlete to progress their rehabilitation on to effective plyometric training

To implement an effective neuromuscular control programme the clinician should have an expansive knowledge of the anatomical structures and entire kinetic chain Knowledge of the specific demands and common mechanisms of injury associated with the athlete’s sport will also aid in reducing the risk of injury and preventing the re-occurrence of previous trauma

The clinician should be able to effectively adapt neuromuscular programme without the risk of the onset and formation of muscle imbalances which in turn may lead to musculoskeletal dysfunction and subsequent injury

For example decreased neuromuscular control of the trunk can increase the risk of knee injury specifically anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury (Zazulak et al 2007) The reason for this being that athletes with reductions in neuromuscular control are more susceptible to increased valgus moments of the knee during the impact phase of jump and landing activities increasing the risk of ACL injury (Hewett et al 2005)

The altered neuromuscular activation of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles are believed to play an important role in this risk of ACL injury Since the hamstrings insert onto the posterior aspect of the tibia and fibular head they provide posterior draw force on the knee that resists anterior tibial forces (Bryant et al 2008) However if there are deficits in muscle activation of the hamstrings there is limited ability to protect the knee ligaments (Hewett et al 2006) Consequently over-dominant quadriceps activation as result of underactive hamstrings is believed to produce anterior displacement of the tibia increasing the risk of ACL injury (Griffin et al 2006)

This is commonly neglected stage of knee rehabilitation that is of particular importance since ACL injury is one of the most common causes of reduced sport participation and is associated with recurrent injury and an increased risk of osteoarthritis of the knee (Walden et al 2006)

Another example is the shoulder joint which allows the greatest range of motion (ROM) of all the joints (Wassinger et al 2007) but as consequence compromises its stability As result in order to maintain optimal dynamic stability effective proprioceptive is necessary to ensure neuromuscular deficits do not impair the athlete's functional ability (Wassinger et al 2007)

This is achieved by enhancing sensory motor control and the ability of the muscles to respond to neural stimulus (Roig-Pull and Ranson 2007)

In addition to shoulder instability lateral ankle sprains are common injury within the sporting arena which has led to research being conducted

To understand the most effective interventions in relation to prevention and treatment by means of balance and coordination training (McKeon and Hertel 2008) The cause of functional instability of the ankle is likely due to altered neuromuscular feedback which changes the neuromuscular response within the appropriate musculature (Coughlan and Caulfield 2007)

Therefore great emphasis should be placed on incorporating neuromuscular control/proprioceptive exercises in the athletes’ rehabilitation programme in order to restore and improve balance coordination and agility thus increasing functional ability of the affected limb and the entire kinetic chain (Subasi et al 2008) Non-injured athletes can also perform neuromuscular control training during their weekly routine training sessions as part of an injury prevention training programme (Paterno et al 2004; Pasanen et al 2008)

# Basic Concepts of Application

As with all stages of injury rehabilitation and the planning of exercise conditioning the development of neuromuscular control programme is also dependent on many factors including gender injury status type of sport and level of competition Since the aim of proprioceptive training programme is to promote balance coordination and agility accordingly (Subasi et al 2008) the athlete must begin first with static exercises before progressing to dynamic exercises The exercises must develop from simple to complex with emphasis placed on precision accuracy and control

The clinician can alter range of variables in order to progress proprioceptive exercises This can involve changing the rate of speed amount of simultaneous activities performed at one time limiting the amount of sight during training and adapting exercises that are more functional with sport-specific movements (Risberg et al 2001)

This is important as adapting the proprioceptive training directly to the neuromuscular response of the athlete throughout the rehabilitation process will simulate similar motor patterns in accordance with the athlete's sport Consequently it has been shown that this may not only enhance performance potential in competitive sporting environment but further play significant role in injury prevention (Hewett et al 2005; Chappell and Limpisvasti 2008; McKeon and Hertel 2008; Twomey et al 2008; Zazulak et al 2007)

It may also be more beneficial to the athlete to perform proprioceptive exercises during the beginning of rehabilitation session or before training routine particularly if the proprioceptive exercises are new to the athlete or are part of more advanced progressions The reason for this is that it has been shown that exercise induces fatigue on the mechanoreceptors that are situated in the musculature surrounding the joint (McLean et al 2007) Since mechanoreceptors are responsible for their of proprioceptive feedback proprioception is affected along with neuromuscular control and therefore negatively impacts the athletes’ ability to perform the proprioception exercises (Myers et al 1999)

# Practical Implementation of Unstable Surface Training

The importance of unstable surface training (UST) has been shown to be beneficial in enhancing proprioceptive enabling neuromuscular adaptations to commence during the early stage rehabilitation process (Cressey et al 2007) This of training has been commonly implemented worldwide with wide range of products However the key consideration is whether this of training should continue throughout the athlete’s rehabilitation

In the latter stages when optimisation of force production and power output are required an unstable surface will result in decrease in force and power output as illustrated from the results of Cressey et al 2007

The majority of sporting movements in the upper extremity occur in an open chain manner; therefore it may be more beneficial to incorporate unstable surface-based exercises under these circumstances rather than in the lower extremity Most athletic movements in the lower limb occur in closed chain fashion in which unstable surface training may prove detrimental to performance in relation to reduced power output The potential decrease in power and strength capacity is due to elevated activation of the antagonist muscle in relation to the prime mover or agonist which although can assist in maintaining joint stability can compromise complete activation of the functional agonist Reciprocal inhibition is physiological response to UST leading to the resulting decrease in force production

# Summary

Continual adaptation to sports specific functional balance training is fundamental to enhancing an athlete’s proprioceptive awareness As result of proprioceptive training receptors in soft tissue structures and joint complexes are trained to perform coherent actions able to initiate dynamic functional movements (Komi 2003) Furthermore by creating more advanced understanding of postural control requirements amongst athletes participating in different sports the practitioner may be able to prescribe the most effective exercises in relation to the balance and coordination demands of the specific sport

# Progressive Systematic Functional Rehabilitation

# Dynamic Proprioceptive Programmes

The question of when best to implement dynamic proprioceptive programme remains controversial Research has yet to fully support arguments surrounding pre versus post training sessions The important factor to consider here is the influence of continuous eccentric muscle contractions on performance caused from over exertion (Lavender and Nosaka 2007) Intermittent high-intensity eccentric training causes micro-trauma within muscle fibres (Clark et al 2005) The breakdown of fibres within the skeletal muscle causes slight alterations in the ability of proprioceptive responses to interact effectively with the central nervous system to initiate effective movement patterns in multi-directional planes of motion

# Strength Endurance and Maximal Strength

To initiate systematic rehabilitation approach through the strength phase it is important to understand the reasons behind why progressive approach is demanded and how the benefits of strength training can relate to improved performance for an athlete on their return to sport It is imperative to ensure athletes progress through the rehabilitation process establishing an adequate level of muscular endurance and then strength (Jarvinen et al 2007) as required by their individual sport

Isometric strength training needs to be considered in the initial rehabilitation phase and is often implemented 3–7 days post injury (Jarvinen et al 2007) usually with focus on preventing muscle atrophy and/or loss of strength Frequency duration and intensity are limited by the patients’ pain Some therapists advocate three sets of 10 repetitions using 5–10 second holds to begin with at intensity within pain tolerance (Pull and Ranson 2007) These then are undertaken at multiple angles beginning in mid range then progressing to inner range (shortened position) then outer range (lengthened position)

The sports rehabilitator should continue to monitor the progress of the athlete taking into consideration exercise frequency intensity and duration Early phase strengthening exercises involve an isometric contraction of the agonist muscle with no movement at the joint The contraction should be performed at different joint angles to initiate muscle fibre activation in different planes of motion The stabilising force surrounding the joint is the antagonist muscle (Middleton and Smith 2007) Pain management and the acknowledgement of pain-free training should be considered simultaneously with the implementation of strength training protocols This is evident within the isometric strength development where the primary goal is to create an adaptive response in the muscle without stressing the joint to excess (Lieben- son 2006)

Once an athlete is able to perform isometric muscle contractions at various joints without the onset of pain it may then be advisable to progress the athlete onto dynamic exercises (Newberry and Bishop 2006) Sports rehabilitators must ensure that the athlete has full bilateral range of motion no swelling or pain prior to implementation of progressive dynamic functional based activity (Beam 2002)

During isotonic exercise the athlete must provide force powerful enough to initiate concentric and eccentric muscle actions whilst coping with constant external load There are different isotonic exercises that could be embedded into the rehabilitation process These can include use of dumbbells machine weights and resistance bands (Beam 2002)

Muscle injuries are associated with preferential atrophy of type 1 muscle fibres with disuse (Stockmar et al 2006) and high loads and rates of force development are most likely to over stress the healing tissue Therefore initially an endurance based programme should be used (3 sets of ≥15 repetitions at 40–60% of one repetition maximum) this should be progressed to strength (4–6 sets of 3-6 repetitions at 85–95% of one repetition maximum and then power training (3–5 sets of 3–5 repetitions at 75–85% of one repetition maximum) (Kraemer et al 2002)

A key consideration during the progression of isotonic training is the velocity at which the movement is performed (Wrbaskic and Dowling 2007) Initially the athlete should perform slow and controlled movements in order to allow for increased neural response to the working muscles and the continued development of neuromuscular control Once the athlete is able to control the exercise effectively the continual progression to sports specific functional activity coupled with changes in velocity increased load and use of different planes of motion should be considered (Liebenson 2006)

Through training the ’s systems and tissues adapt in direct response to the stresses imposed on them

# General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)

The adaptation responses can be explained through the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) first described by Hans Selye in 1985 The GAS incorporates three primary phases: the alarm phase the resistance phase and the exhaustion phase of resistance or aerobic conditioning program

The alarm phase often occurs following the introduction of new stimulus into training program and can lead to the onset of delayed onset muscular soreness (DOMS) joint stiffness and general feeling of discomfort following training session (Brown 2007)

The resistance phase is when training adaptations occur and the muscles are able to respond effectively to the physiological changes within the (Newton 2006) This phase tests the ability of the to withstand various mechanical forces which may ultimately lead to increased neuromuscular function within the trained musculature

If however training continues without the appropriate introduction of new stimulus the exhaustion phase is emphasized (Epley 2004) This can result from too high volume of training or progressions in intensity that are too large or rapid resulting in poorly prescribed and/or implemented training regime

The general adaptation syndrome is useful when designing and deciding on how best to progress or regress exercise intensity In relation to rehabilitation the practitioner must understand the three stages of the GAS and be able to adapt any implemented exercise protocol with regards to injury rehabilitation

# Phases of General Adaptation Syndrome

- Alarm Phase: Initial adaptive response leading to soreness stiffness and decrease in performance
- Resistance Phase: Adapts to stimulus efficiently leading to optimal functioning
- Exhaustion Phase: Decrease ability to adapt to stimulus resulting in fatigue and injury

To adequately and effectively design progressive rehabilitation programmes it is important to relate biomechanical principles such as force-velocity relationships to the rehabilitation process Komi (2003) argues that exercise programmes should be devised in accordance with the relative power output requirements of the sport

There are many varied examples in sport that highlight the importance of including power-specific exercises into rehabilitation programmes Sports such as netball tennis squash American football and basketball all require explosive movements in multiplanar directions and would therefore benefit directly from exercises that incorporate high-velocity actions However in relation to progressive rehabilitation it is still imperative to ensure the athlete attains isometric strength prior to continued progression through the strength training

Velocity (arbitrary units)

In the continuum of rehabilitation it is crucial to ensure that exercises simulate competitive environment where injuries are most likely to occur (Verrall et al 2005) Once adequate concentric strength has been developed it is essential to focus on both the velocity of concentric exercises and the emphasis on eccentric strength Evidence suggests that eccentric training during rehabilitation reduces the risk of recurring injuries and when used prior to injury it reduces the occurrence of injury (Askling et al 2003; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Clark et al 2005; Brooks et al 2006; Gabbe et al 2006; Arnason et al 2008)

Eccentric loading especially at high velocities such as during plyometric training may lead to significant muscle damage particularly if there has been limited muscular endurance and strength training (Schache et al 2008) resulting in delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) The rehabilitation process depends on the progress of each individual and must be adapted as required It is important for the clinician to monitor the athlete's progress and determine when to enhance the proprioceptive and strength capacity of the individual (Gokaraju et al 2008)

Training for muscular strength and endurance must cover all areas of the force-velocity curve (Figure 127) usually progressing from isometric focused through to concentric and eccentric beginning at low velocities and progressing to high velocity activities

# Plyometric Training

To appreciate the importance of plyometric training as part of sport-specific rehabilitation program the components of athletic movement need to be considered (Epley 2004) All sports and athletic movements require the optimum functioning of active muscles to produce muscular forces at varying speeds through multiple planes of motion This is known as the force-velocity relationship and can be used to describe the term power

Power is present in all sports or activities involving rapid force production (Brown et al 2007) Plyometric training is of resistance training that involves high-velocity based exercises characterized by quick eccentric (lengthened) muscle contractions followed by rapid concentric (shortened) muscle contractions This is achieved through process termed the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) (Shiner et al 2005) These exercises enhance power production by increasing motor-unit recruitment rate of muscle firing and sensitivity and excitability of the neuromuscular system thereby promoting optimum neuromuscular efficiency (Newberry and Bishop 2006) Plyometric activities also take advantage of the elastic components of the tissues (tendons muscles and fascia) along with the increased motor recruitment due to the stretch reflex

Plyometric training offers progressive approach to incorporating functional sport-specific movements

# Plyometric Training

-container 

# Plyometric Training

Plyometric training enhances anaerobic power (Faigenhbaum et al 2007) strength (Marques et al 2008) agility (Thomas et al 2009) and speed (Myer et al 2005) in preparation for full return to sport participation with an emphasis on the prevention of re-injury through the enhancement of eccentric and neuromuscular control (Gilchrist et al 2008; Hewett et al 2006)

# Assessment Before Commencing Plyometric Training

Before starting plyometric program the athlete must be assessed for:

- Components of lumbo-pelvic (core) stability
- Neuromuscular control (especially during ground contact)
- Optimum functional movement to enable the required rate of muscle contraction while reducing the risk of potential injury

Constant observational assessments should be conducted such as postural assessments and lower limb control during landing

# Requirements for Plyometric Training

In addition to optimum kinematics the athlete must possess:

- Appropriate components of strength
- Proprioception
- Range of Motion (ROM) (Chmielewski et al 2006)

Adequate levels of strength will enable the athlete to perform the exercises with sufficient control minimizing the risk of injury Strength requirements vary depending on the particular exercise For example Chu (1998) suggests that athletes should be able to perform squat with at least 60% of their weight for five repetitions in no less than five seconds to ensure adequate velocity during the concentric phase of loading

# Importance of Landing Phase

The landing or loading phase of plyometric exercise is particularly important as it initiates the stretch-shortening cycle and subsequent force production (Rassier and Herzog 2005) Therefore prior to full plyometric training emphasis should be placed on perfecting the landing component with technique-based drills This should have already been addressed during earlier stages of rehabilitation that focused on neuromuscular control

# Implementation of Plyometric Exercises

Plyometric exercise can be implemented when the athlete can sustain moderate loading during basic strengthening exercises and perform functional movement patterns efficiently (Chmielewski et al 2006) Balance coordination and agility are important components of proprioception that will enable the athlete to control the explosive and intensive movements involved with plyometric training (Chmielewski et al 2006) An appropriate level of flexibility is also required to perform plyometrics which is governed by tissue extensibility at joint dictating the degree of ROM available during active movement (Bradley and Portas 2007)

# Progressive and Periodized Training

Plyometric training should be progressive and periodized to allow for increases in velocity of movement or deceleration forces depending on the athlete's aims and sport requirements It is essential to continue with some strength training to prevent detraining effect and loss of strength Progression for sport-specific activities should develop from unidirectional to bidirectional to multidirectional movements (Heidt et al 2000)

# Plyometrics in Water

Plyometrics can also be effectively performed in water (Robinson et al 2004)

According to Stemm and Jacobson (2007) the buoyancy of water reduces impact forces and stress on the muscular system allowing plyometric training to be introduced to athletes at an earlier stage in their development or rehabilitation Burgess et al (2007) and Kubo et al (2007) also found that plyometric training has beneficial effect on tendon and joint stiffness which may reduce the risk of injuries

To enable the appropriate development of rehabilitation programmes that take into account not only the demands of the athlete’s sport but also the demands of their training regimes Sports Rehabilitators require comprehensive understanding of strength and conditioning principles and practices Collaboration between the strength and conditioning staff and the rehabilitator(s) generally ensures that the athlete is not only appropriately prepared for return to sport in terms of their injury but also in terms of their physical conditioning and fitness

Appropriate conditioning is essential not only to optimise performance but also to reduce the risk of injury Research has demonstrated that strength and conditioning training not only improves performance in strength power and speed related sports and activities (Wilsoff et al 2004; Cronin and Hansen 2005; Hori et al 2008) but also in endurance-based sports and activities (Paavolainen et al 1999; Spurrs et al 2002; Turner et al 2003) There is also large of evidence that has found that certain methods of strength and conditioning training can reduce injury risk (Ford et al 2003; Hewett et al 2005; Kato et al 2008; Kaminski et al 1998; Mjolsnes et al 2004; Kilgallon et al 2007; Holcomb et al 2007)

The aim of this chapter is to highlight the different methods of strength and conditioning that are commonly used during different phases of progressive periodised training programme and to summarise the adaptive responses that can be expected from each mode of training The chapter then progresses on to summary of how appropriate interventions within strength and conditioning programme may reduce the risk of injury assist in the later stages of rehabilitation programme and effectively reduce the risk of re-injury

In order to fully appreciate the concepts presented in this chapter this should be studied in conjunction with the chapter on periodisation (Chapter 9)

In most sports it is not the maximum force produced that determines success; it is the strength that can be produced explosively For example sprinter does not have time to produce maximal strength in the short period it takes to leave the blocks at the start of race Success in the start depends on another attribute of strength; in this case the magnitude of force that can be produced quickly The best athletes are not always the strongest but are often the most explosive Even in highly skilled games like soccer explosive ability (assessed by short sprint and jumping performance) can differentiate between levels of success (Brewer and Davis 1991; Kollath and Quade 1993) Explosive strength is often referred to as power which is defined as the rate of performing work The faster any given weight is lifted (or other resistance overcome) the greater the power

# Training for Strength

Strength attributes can be enhanced by number of different training methods including:

- Heavy resistance training (Newton and Kraemer 1994; Harris et al 2008)
- Plyometrics (Verkhoshansky 1986; Markovic 2007; Thomas et al 2009)
- Complex training (Fleck and Kontor 1986; Duthie et al 2002; Weber et al 2008)
- Assisted and resisted training (DeRenne et al 1990 1994; Faccioni 1994a 1994b; Jakalski 1998; Escamilla et al 2000)
- Explosive isometrics (Olsen and Hopkins 1999; Siff and Verkhoshansky 1999; Kubo et al 2001; Burgess et al 2007)
- Eccentric training (Morrissey et al 1995; Askling et al 2003; Arnason et al 2008)
- Olympic style lifting (Garhammer and Gregor 1992; Takano 1992; Hoffman et al 2004; Channell and Barfield 2008)

Each of these methods produces adaptations that are specific to the attributes trained For example:

- Heavy resistance training stimulates the development of maximal strength (powerlifting)
- Power training develops force application at high velocities (throwing and jumping events)
- Explosive isometric training develops rate of force development at low velocities (sprint start)
- Eccentric emphasized training develops rapid eccentric strength which may decrease the risk of injury during deceleration and agility drills

# Explosive Force Production

Few sports rely exclusively on maximal strength The most notable sport that does rely on strength is Powerlifting where performance of the bench press dead lift and squat is exclusively dependent on an athlete’s ability to produce force Powerlifting therefore depends more on strength than power

In contrast success in most other sports depends on explosive force production or power which in turn depends on both the magnitude of force produced (strength) and the rate at which it is applied (speed) Often the rate of force development is more important to sporting success than the magnitude of force developed

For example in athletic throwing events it is not the heaviest lifters who throw the discus shot hammer and javelin the furthest but often the most explosive The most common methods of training for the development of power include Olympic style lifting plyometrics and complex training

While there is relationship between maximal strength and power-based performance such as sprinting and jumping (Wilsoff et al 2004; Cronin and Hansen 2005) strength alone does not determine success Rather it is the proportion of that strength that can be utilized quickly and the efficiency with which that strength is integrated into sport-specific movement patterns

For example rookie shot putter may possess all the explosiveness necessary for elite performance but if the power cannot be generated in sport-specific movement patterns and harnessed through correct technique then they will not achieve full potential Training must be designed such that any gains in strength transfer to improved performance

# Rate of Force Development

Sporting movements occur quickly often between 30 and 200 ms The length of the contact time during maximal sprinting is between 70 and 125 ms (Kunz and Kaufmann 1981; Mann and Herman 1985; Moravec et al 1988) which is not long enough for athletes to produce their maximum force Therefore prior to competition training should focus on maximizing the force that can be developed quickly (increasing rate of force development) The quicker sprinter can generate force the faster they will be

Athlete B clearly has the highest force production and can be considered the stronger of the two athletes Athlete A however has greater rate of force development (RFD) and is stronger than athlete B in the initial stages of contraction (up to point C) The arrows D and E represent the differences in force production between athlete A and athlete B at 125ms and 200ms respectively

As most sporting movements require explosive force production within the first 200ms athlete A can be considered as better conditioned for their sport and should be more successful If however the athlete was power lifter or rugby forward where production of maximal strength of longer duration determines success in lift or scrum respectively then athlete B can be considered as better conditioned for their sport and should be more successful

# Training to Maximize Rate of Force Development

# Training to Maximize Rate of Force Development (RFD)

Force development (RFD) is crucial in athletic performance Both the magnitude and the rate of force development are essential For instance Weyand et al (2000) found that faster running speeds were attributed to greater ground reaction forces rather than increases in limb speed

# Enhancing Rate of Force Development

The rate of force development is best enhanced by training explosive movements where the intention is to accelerate the resistance (either bar medicine ball or the ) as quickly as possible While slow heavy exercises increase strength (and therefore the maximum force athletes can produce) they do not enhance the force development within the first 200ms of contraction which is required by sport in conditioned athletes (Hakkinen and Komi 1985; Zatsiorsky 1995) However very heavy resistance exercise can increase RFD within the first 200ms in individuals who have not previously participated in structured resistance training via enhanced neural drive (Aagaard et al 2002) It is important to note that all these types of training play role within well-developed periodized training program

It is essential that complete rehabilitation program prepares the athlete for such demands rather than concentrating on isometric strength or low-velocity concentric strength as with most traditional rehabilitation programs In periodized model heavy training should precede explosive training

# Specific Training Focus

Although explosive-ballistic training is effective at improving rate of force development and strength in the initial stages of muscle action (up to 200ms) it is still possible to focus training even more accurately For example during sprint ground contact times and therefore the time over which an athlete can generate useful force change throughout the race At the beginning of the race when the athlete drives out of the blocks and accelerates for the first few strides the ground contact time can be greater than 340ms and 200ms respectively (Mero 1988) whereas when the athlete reaches peak running velocity the contact time is nearer to 70–125ms

This knowledge is crucial to help athletes focus training more specifically on their strengths and weaknesses

Weaknesses in an athlete's performance can be identified and addressed through targeted training For instance if an athlete accelerates well for the first few meters but struggles to maintain speed training that focuses on shorter ground contact times (short response or reactivity training) such as plyometrics may be beneficial In soccer sprints typically last between 12 and 22 meters (Bangsbo et al 1991; Drust et al 1998)

Long-jumpers and high-jumpers exhibit different ground contact times during takeoff (125ms and 200ms respectively) Therefore training should focus on different aspects of strength development The long-jumper should emphasize exercises with shorter contact times (short response) while the high-jumper should focus on exercises with longer contact times (long response) especially prior to competition

# Physio Knowledge - Short and Long Response Training

# Short Response Training - Reactivity Training

Short response (reactivity) training is specifically designed to help athletes accept and produce forces over very short periods (typically 75–200ms) This type of training is fundamental to maximizing sprinting speed and jumping ability as these activities require athletes to accept and produce ground reaction forces quickly The best type of training for reactivity is plyometrics focusing on those with short ground contact time

Plyometric training involves very quick light yet powerful activities like quick feet skips and low amplitude jumps Emphasis should be placed on speed maximizing the rate of stretch minimizing ground contact time and good technique rather than height jumped the height of the box jumped from and the length of the bound Although the height of the subsequent jump does increase with increasing drop heights (due to an increase in the rate of stretch at landing) this only occurs up to threshold height (Bosco and Komi 1979) Above this height the rate of stretch is too high and the golgi tendon organ (GTO) reflex inhibits muscle contraction (Schmidtbleicher et al 1988) lessening subsequent jump height

Training aimed at developing the reactive elements of muscle contraction should not use drop heights greater than this threshold Although Kreighbaum and Katherine (1996) suggest platform height of no more than 20cm to minimize the risk of injury for many athletes the threshold occurs at heights much greater than this although usually no higher than 60cm It is also worth noting that plyometrics can be effectively performed in water (Robinson et al 2004; Stemm and Jacobson 2007) thereby reducing the impact forces due to the buoyancy of the water and allowing plyometric training to be introduced to athletes at an earlier stage in their development/rehabilitation

Plyometric training has been shown to have beneficial effect on tendon and joint stiffness (Burgess et al 2007; Kubo et al 2007a) which may reduce the risk of injuries

# Short Response Training Summary

|Intensity|Exercise|Reps|Sets|
|---|---|---|---|
|Low|Mini hurdle jumps cone jumps line jumps|25|5|
|Medium|Hexagon drill line hops|15–20|3|
|High|Full hurdle jumps depth jumps|6–10|3–5|

It is essential to remember that plyometric training places high neurological demand on the athlete and is therefore most effective when athletes are well rested

# Long Response Training

Long-response training refers to the training of powerful explosive movements with contact or application time of more than 200ms By comparison with short response training long response training is characterized by greater amplitude of movement about the hip knee and ankle joints and also by the use of greater external resistance Whereas short-response training is dominated by quickness of movement long response training is dominated more by strength

Long response movements include activities ranging in speed from faster activities of around 200ms (bounding tire pulling single leg hopping and depth jumping) to longer activities of up to 500ms (unweighted squat jumps one-legged jump-squats and weighted jump squats) This type of training can enhance force production acceleration from standing start and height jumped

# Training Methods

The inclusion of depth jumps in training resulted in an increased jump height Research has also demonstrated that including drop jumps (five jumps from 60cm box) within dynamic warm-up results in an increase in subsequent power-based activities (Hilfiker et al 2007) It is essential that the training programme meets the physiological biomechanical and metabolic requirements of the sport; these will be introduced later on in the chapter

# Isometric Training

In contrast to the beneficial effects of explosive training compared with heavy strength training research has demonstrated that isometric training can also result in increases in rate of force development (RFD) power and vertical jump height which is attributed to increases in tendon stiffness (Kubo et al 2001; Bojsen-Moller et al 2005; Kubo et al 2007b; Burgess et al 2007) It is worth noting however that this type of isometric training must be performed with the intention of explosive movement and should not be the sole method of training It is generally incorporated into the ‘normal’ training session as few additional sets

A key concept to understand is the force-velocity relationship of skeletal muscles applied to training methodologies and the requirements of sporting activities This includes both concentric and eccentric muscle actions that are responsible for acceleration and deceleration respectively which therefore corresponds to improvements in agility It is essential that these concepts are applied when identifying the mechanics of the sport/activity and integrated into the exercise selection process

# Intensity

# Overload

This is usually referred to as ‘progressive overload’ More often however of ‘fluctuating overload’ is applied as part of periodised training programme (Siff 2004) Failure to periodise in this manner by attempting an unlimited linear progression will either result in stagnation and plateau in training or increase the risk of injury due to lack of appropriate adaptation See Chapter 9 for more detail on periodisation

# Overload and Supercompensation

For adaptations to occur the training stimulus must be at level beyond that normally encountered Training at level or intensity that is beyond that normally encountered is called overload and it is this overload that stimulates the adaptations that allow the athlete to tolerate an increased level of training stress

Training causes physiological biochemical and mechanical stresses Immediately post-training these result in tissue damage and metabolic neural and psychological fatigue limiting performance and making the athlete (temporarily) less able to perform (For period post-training the athlete is actually less fit) Once training has finished however recovery begins This process involves restoration of physiological and biochemical balance (homeostasis) repair of tissue and replenishment of muscle

Recovery involves restoring muscle and liver fuel stores Depending on the type intensity and duration of the training – as well as the quality of rest and nutrition – full recovery can take from few hours to several days (or weeks depending on the intensity and duration of training)

Once pre-exercise levels have been restored recovery is still not complete The continues to adapt rebuilding and remodelling itself until higher state of readiness is reached For short period of time an athlete’s fitness is enhanced This is known as super-compensation (adaptation) The time period during which super-compensation occurs provides window of opportunity during which the athlete should train again If the athlete trains during this period of super-compensation the cycle is repeated and fitness continues to improve If however the athlete does nothing during this key period then the will re-adapt to the current lower activity level Any enhanced state-of-readiness or fitness that occurred as result of super-compensation will be lost

# Timing

The timing of the next training session is vital and varies according to the recovery abilities of the athlete and the demands imposed by the previous session For example well-conditioned athlete can recover from long training run within 24 hours (excluding the skeletal system) whereas the same athlete may take 10 days to recover from heavy resistance training session involving rapid eccentric activities and supra-maximal loads

Once an athlete has adapted to specific training load or stimulus (for example running five miles three times per week at constant pace) then further gains can only be made if the training load is increased This is known as the principle of progressive overload The runner will not improve beyond the fitness level needed to run five miles three times per week at that constant pace Once that level of fitness is achieved it will remain static In order to improve their running ability further the stimulus must be increased The runner could run faster farther more often use interval training or run on more challenging route

The progressive increases in fitness due to repeated training sessions are illustrated in Figure 139 Note that each successive training session coincides with the point during recovery when gains from the previous session have been maximised – the ‘window of opportunity’ Although the stimulus to improve comes from the training session itself all improvements occur when the athlete rests If the rest period is too short and the athlete trains again before full recovery has

# Training and Recovery in Fitness

# Progressive Increases in Fitness

When adequate recovery does not occur fitness will cease to improve and may even decline During such situations athletes are more susceptible to overtraining syndrome injury and illness Therefore adequate recovery is essential to successful training program

# Shock Training

There are times when athletes may perform successive hard training sessions in block without allowing full recovery For few days athletes accumulate fatigue which shocks the system and provides an opportunity—when sufficient recovery is later allowed—to stimulate further adaptations This method can also be used to ensure that an athlete peaks for specific competition (Pistilli et al 2008)

This advanced training method is known as shock training (planned overreaching) and should only be used by athletes who already have solid training base Careful observation and monitoring are required as shock training itself represents the initial stages of overtraining condition that can lead to negative adaptations

that is associated with both increased injury and ill-
ness risk and well as reduction in performance
There is often fine line between providing the opti-
mum stimulus for adaptation and inducing state of
over-training and susceptibility to injury and illness

Adaptation potential
An athlete’s adaptation potential (or capacity for
improvement) is function of both their genetic
makeup and their current level of fitness Genetic
makeup an athlete’s ultimate potential for success
is fixed and therefore not responsive to training
(Brzycki 1989) The major factor determining an
athlete’s adaptation potential then is their current
state of fitness relative to their genetic ceiling
 The primary training aim of all athletes should be
to fulfil their genetic potential This is never easy As
athletes get fitter and more skilled they find it increas-
ingly more difficult to make further improvements –
they get diminishing returns for their efforts As they
approach their genetic ceiling further improvements
become almost impossible (Figure 1312)
 Conversely athletes that are unfit have the greatest
capacity to improve For these athletes increases in
fitness occur rapidly in response to training These
rapid improvements however can occur indepen-
dent of training quality Even poorly designed train-
ing programmes will elicit improvements in the short
term In the medium term however such training
will plateau bad habits can and the athlete
may not fulfil their true potential
 It is crucial; therefore that athletes and coaches
adopt the same thorough and careful approach to
training programme design with all athletes what-
ever their age and training status A well-designed
programme in the early stages ultimately lays the
foundation for future success

Training parameters

The training parameters that contribute towards the
overall training effect include: frequency intensity
and duration of training sessions; the quality and
quantity of rest between and during sessions; and
speciﬁcity Each of these parameters can be com-
bined and manipulated within training programme
to elicit the desired training effect(See Tables 132
and 133 for specific recommendations)

# Table 134: Adaptation Rates Following Training

|Fitness Attribute|Rate of Adaptation|
|---|---|
|Flexibility|Days|
|Strength|Weeks|
|Sport Specific Endurance|Weeks to Months|
|Speed|Several Months|
|Work Capacity|Months to Years|

Flexibility can occur within days whereas improvements in speed may take months In addition strength improvements can occur within weeks; sport specific endurance may take weeks and months; and overall work capacity will only improve gradually over period of months and years Athletes and coaches must also be aware that different systems adapt at different rates following training For example with strength training the rate of adaptation of tendons and bones is slow compared to the rate of adaptation of muscle The consequences of this are that muscles get stronger quicker and pull on tendons that are yet to adapt to the stresses of training This leads to the potential for injury

# Detraining

All improvements in fitness are reversible What an athlete can gain with training they can lose with detraining When athletes stop or reduce their training their systems adjust accordingly This presents as loss of strength and power decrease in maximal aerobic capacity and loss of coordination Although detraining of strength and power is relatively slow particularly with the inclusion of some eccentric exercise the detraining of endurance is more rapid with significant effects noticed in days and weeks

Overall the de-training effects of short-term break (1–2 weeks) are relatively small especially if physical activity levels remain high; however longer or more frequent periods of inactivity have greater cumulative impact on overall fitness Thus when athletes resume training after layoff or injury they cannot start at the level (intensity duration or complexity) at which they left off Care must therefore be taken when designing training sessions that occur after an injury or other long lay-off In such cases gradual and progressive re-introduction to full training will carry fewer risks of re-injury and produce more sustainable gains than other more intense methods Many athletes and coaches are keen to make up for lost time and consequently train too hard too soon risking both injury and possible over-training

It is far better therefore to minimize fitness losses in the first place To minimize fitness losses injured athletes must examine strategies within their treatment and rehabilitation which enable them to continue to exercise One such strategy may involve the use of alternative low-risk activities that do not stress the injury For example rowing stationary cycling and deep water running are all excellent methods of maintaining general cardiovascular fitness when injured; strength training can be targeted towards key movements in non-injured areas; whilst proprioception training of the non-injured limb can provide useful crossover benefits to the injured limb

# Specificity

The most important element of functional conditioning is the principle of specificity The principle of specificity dictates that training should match the demands of the sport Given that sport consists of many components – with successful athletes needing to start stop twist turn run jump land shuffle push pull hit bend throw catch hop accelerate decelerate slide block and barge all within the fluid dynamic and unpredictable environment of sport and all without getting injured – we are presented with complex problem It is also worth noting however that open kinetic chain exercises such as leg flexion have little effect on performance of sport specific movements but may help to address muscle imbalances

Training that does not relate directly to the movements and activity patterns found in sport is waste Unfortunately many athletes still employ training methods that are non-sport specific These methods are often prescriptive predictable and sterile Many are based on one-size-fits-all training systems reported to be the secret of another athlete’s success
---
# Physio Knowledge - Specificity

note 

# Specificity

Many lack sufficient variety using repetitive schedules that soon lead to plateau in performance Most fail to account for the fluid unpredictable and three-dimensional nature of sport In essence they fail to stimulate athletes in truly sport-specific way

Despite the best intentions of coaches and athletes too much conditioning time and energy is directed towards superfluous non-specific activity For example when strength training many athletes monitor their progress by how much they can squat or bench press and focus training towards these exercises Sport however typically requires strength to be expressed in faster more dynamic and in three-dimensional fashion

Although relationship has been demonstrated between squat strength and both sprint speed and vertical jump height (Wilsoff et al 2004) and heavy bench press appears to be an appropriate pre-load activity for performing complex training on functional movements (Matthews et al 2009) squatting and bench press alone do not prepare an athlete for all movement patterns required in sport Too much training time devoted to non-functional movements takes training focus away from sports-specific activities and causes extra fatigue forcing the to recover from training that does have direct effect on performance

However the reverse is also true where athletes spend too much time focusing on sports-specific training and lack adequate strength and power development required to produce an increase in sports performance Less sports-specific movements however can provide good solid base (general preparation phase) from which an athlete can progress to more specific conditioning (pre-competition and peaking phases) (see Chapter 9: An Introduction to Periodisation)

# Effective Conditioning

To condition athletes effectively training must mimic the conditions encountered in sport To achieve this programme designers must:

1 Analyse the demands of the sport;
2 Identify the individual characteristics of the athlete (strengths and weaknesses; training history);
3 Tailor and prioritise training to allow each individual athlete to meet these specific demands

It is essential that the training programme is specific in terms of the metabolic demands (energy systems) (see Chapter 3; Needs Analysis ) and mechanical demands (muscle action force velocity range of motion)

# Mechanical Demands

The mechanical demands of sport determine the movements that athletes should train Exercises that mimic the actual movements encountered in sport should be prioritised By focusing on movement pattern specificity athletes can reinforce and condition the actual motor programmes used in skilled performance These programmes control the precise order timing velocity force application and muscle action to enable the muscles to produce predetermined movement (Enoka 1994) The more practiced and efficient these programmes the better the performance of the skill

For example rugby player who focuses practice on the foot patterns required to side step an opponent can enhance side-stepping performance by executing quicker more efficient motor programmes However it is also worth noting that if the athlete does not have the eccentric strength to enable them to decelerate or the power to re-accelerate in another direction practising footwork will have little effect

The best training for movement pattern specificity is to practice the actual skills involved in sport; however ensuring progressive overload in these activities is not always possible Repetition of the skill is feasible for many sports; however there are sports and situations where it is not practical or safe to perform high volumes of the specific patterns frequently A triple-jumper or long-jumper for example who only trains by performing the actual jump skills would soon break down due to the constant repetition of intense impacts

For these athletes other less intensive methods should be used that mimic closely the actual movements involved These methods focus on the ranges speeds and forces encountered allowing the development of fitness attributes in functional way that may ultimately allow athletes to tolerate more actual (jumping) practice For example heavy force-acceptance strength training fast force-acceptance strength training dynamic control and stabilisation training along with specific jumping drills will increase an athlete’s capacity to tolerate actual skill practice in the highly intensive triple jump

The training methods that transfer best to actual sporting performance usually involve coordinated movements across multiple joints rather than strict isolation exercises In sport no muscle works in isolation Isolating specific muscles then is non-functional; gains in strength power or endurance
---
# Strength and Conditioning

Training should focus on movements rather than isolated muscles to enhance functional performance effectively For instance sprint start requires rapid and forceful triple extension of the hip knee and ankle along with rapid flexion at the shoulder on the same side and rapid extension on the opposite side plus torso that is rigid enough to control and transfer forces from one segment to another Athletes must therefore train movements that target these areas

Multi-joint all- dynamic movements that are unilateral or cyclic (eg one-legged jump squats; split jump lunges) are far more specific than single joint bilateral isolation exercises performed slowly (eg leg extensions; leg curls) Traditional basic strength exercises like back squats and squat jumps may not be cyclical but they allow the athlete to focus on generating maximal forces as explosively as possible as required in the initial strides during sprint start They are sport-specific in terms of being multi-joint triple extension exercises and forces generated; however they are non-sport specific in terms of their velocity and their bilateral nature

Typically sporting movements involve standing or running producing and accepting forces in multiple directions and planes and at various speeds all in fluid and ever-changing environment Training should mimic this Exercises that require athletes to stand on their feet are always more specific to sport than exercises that require them to sit or lie Sport is not played lying down Equally exercises that involve multiple joints resemble sporting movements far better than those involving single joints As previously mentioned it is essential to note that single joint exercises have little effect on the performance of sports-specific movements (Augustsson et al 1998; Blackburn and Morrissey 1998; Augustsson and Thomee 2000)

Focusing training towards the actual mechanics of the movements (magnitude of force direction of force velocity of movement muscle actions involved level of stability required etc) required by sport is clearly paramount to optimal conditioning In sport however success rarely relies on the execution of one single discreet movement; there are always other movements either preceding or following the current one One focus (and often neglected area) of training is training athletes to transfer fluidly and efficiently from one movement to another In sport no movement ever stands alone

For example tennis serve appears to be one-off stand-alone skill; however this is not the case Players must be ready to sprint or lunge to any point on the court to intercept the return ball The follow-through from serve will merge with the next skill and the more efficiently this occurs the quicker player can intercept and play the next shot Equally if tennis player can explode laterally from sideways lunge position ( forehand on the edge of the court) then they stand better chance of reaching the next shot If prior to this however they exhibit inefficient deceleration mechanics and poor force-acceptance going into the shot then the whole movement will be slower

Success in sport then requires athletes to train in sport-specific way By analyzing the movement patterns (force velocity muscle action joint angles) involved in sports and replicating those in training athletes can not only develop strength speed power endurance and flexibility in truly functional way but also integrate and perfect combinations of movements to replicate typical patterns of play

As well as training to produce force we must also focus on the athlete’s ability to accept force Sport requires athletes to reduce and absorb external forces often at high speeds in three dimensions and in an unpredictable fashion Athletes must train for deceleration and force-acceptance as well as force production This will prepare athletes to meet the varied stresses of sport and have major impact on injury prevention

For example the hamstrings are typically trained concentrically using knee flexion exercises (leg curls) and hip extension exercises (Romanian deadlifts) In function however the hamstrings also act eccentrically to control and decelerate the limb (as in kicking football) act antagonistically to the rectus femoris to prevent hip flexion (as in squatting or jumping) and act eccentrically as an ACL agonist by preventing anterior tibial translation thereby reducing shear forces and increasing knee stability (Aagaard et al 1998; Li et al 1999; Escamilla et al 2001; Kingma et al 2004; Ahmed et al 2006) Movements that target these attributes may include jumps one-legged squats squat jumps and practice kicks increasing progressively in terms of both velocity and amplitude

# Injury Prevention

# Injury Prevention

Training must be appropriately conditioned and strengthened concentrically and eccentrically at low velocities (for example using Nordic hamstring lowers)
Sport-specific movement patterns are also enhanced by training at greater speeds in multiple directions and under varied and unpredictable conditions to challenge an athlete’s balance and proprioception
This enhances their ability to stabilize joints and maintain posture allowing the transfer of forces efficiently from one to another
Exercises such as plyometrics which incorporate fast eccentric loading in the initial phases and place high demand on an athlete’s ability to dynamically stabilize their joints under varying conditions also allow them to develop greater control and accept higher forces quickly

The other advantage is that training the specific movement patterns involved in sport motivates the athlete by helping them see the relevance of the training
This helps the athlete gauge their own progress in functional way and leads to increased motivation relaxation training focus and general psychological well-being

# Avoidable versus Unavoidable Injuries

There are two types of injuries: those that can be avoided through appropriate conditioning and those that cannot
In situations where high-velocity high-energy collision coincides with vulnerable joint position injury is usually unavoidable
Under such circumstances (vulnerable joint positions; high-velocity high-energy collisions) there is little that can be done to condition against injury
Although protective clothing rule changes and good umpiring can limit such encounters they can never be completely removed from the dynamic and unpredictable conditions of sport

In contrast if an injury occurs during the performance of common sporting task (twisting away from an opponent; landing from jump; sprinting for ball)
then it is likely that appropriate conditioning could have either prevented the injury or lessened its severity
In this case number of researchers have identified that activities that improve lower limb control such as drop landing and plyometric training
can decrease knee valgus during deceleration-related activities and therefore reduce the risk of non-contact injuries

|Avoidable|When the injury occurs during the performance of common sporting task (twisting away from an opponent; landing from jump; sprinting for ball) Appropriate conditioning may have either prevented the injury or lessened its severity|

# ACL Injuries

Of all the factors that may pre-dispose an athlete to injury lack of appropriate conditioning is the one that can be most readily altered Any injury that occurs without contact with other players may be avoided through correct conditioning Injuries that occur when landing twisting or stopping are often the result of inappropriate muscular activation and inefficient mechanics of landing or deceleration which may in turn be worsened under conditions of fatigue

One example of injury risk being reduced via appropriate conditioning is that of hamstring strains with number of authors demonstrating that emphasis on eccentric conditioning of the hamstrings (Nordic Curls) increases hamstring strength and reduces the incidence of injuries

If muscles are activated in an efficient and coordinated manner they can brace the joint under conditions of dynamic load (such as those encountered during sport) and help prevent injuries otherwise attributable to weakness or laxity of ligaments Appropriate conditioning (involving strength agility endurance force acceptance control technique proprioception and reactive neuromuscular components) is crucial to both the prevention and rehabilitation of injuries

Female athletes appear more susceptible to non-contact injuries particularly during twisting and jumping sports where they sustain four times as many knee injuries than males Reasons for this may include joint laxity higher Q angle narrow inter-condylar notch smaller ACL and lack of appropriate conditioning specifically poor neuromuscular control and gluteal activation Of these only lack of conditioning can be addressed As approximately 80% of all Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries occur without physical contact between players preventative conditioning strategies become paramount particularly in female athletes

# Integrating Strength and Conditioning into Rehabilitation Programme

In the past the main focus of rehabilitation has been on healing and re-establishing mobility strength and endurance about an injured joint These goals whilst important components in any rehabilitation programme are often assessed in ways that are not specific to the individual taking little account of the specific demands (both on the injured area and the as whole) imposed by the sport

|Joint laxity|✗|
|Higher Q angle|✗|

# Integrating Strength and Conditioning into Rehabilitation Programme

# Integrating Strength and Conditioning into Rehabilitation Programme

Sport; ROM has often been assessed passively over single joints and in single planes rather than actively during sport specific tasks; and endurance has been assessed by the ability to perform prescribed number of exercise repetitions rather than the ability to stabilise joints over repeated functional movements and under the conditions of fatigue that mimic those during game Athletes can walk out of clinic with pre-injury levels of strength endurance and ROM and by traditional measures of progress be considered fit enough to return to sport (see Figure 1315 and Table 137) Unfortunately achieving clinical and non-functional (non-sport specific) goals means little when it comes to actual sporting performance and prevention of re-injury

Strength endurance and mobility are important factors in rehabilitation but are only effective for performance and injury prevention when combined with adequate proprioception and neuromuscular control and integrated into the complex and coordinated movement patterns and skills that characterise sport These skills typically require precision occur at high movement velocities in multiple planes and depend on constant stream of sensory information

# Table 137: Traditional versus Sport Specific (Functional) Rehabilitation

|Traditional Rehabilitation|Functional Rehabilitation|

# Strength and Conditioning

To perform properly (see periodised training plan for an athlete post-ACL surgery in Chapter 9 An Introduction to Periodisation)

# Sport Specific Rehabilitation

Sport specific rehabilitation provides framework for athletes to bridge the gap between these traditional rehabilitation outcomes and the specific demands of sport and involves sequential progression of ever more challenging and specific exercises Athletes begin rehabilitation as soon as possible post-injury and continue until full functional capacity (specific to the demands of their sports) is restored At each stage athletes will perform exercises appropriate to their level of healing and their level of proprioception and control whilst aiming to incorporate functional elements from their sport

In the early phases post-injury the exercises will be simple and predictable in nature performed slowly with minimal loading In the later stages exercises will be complex high velocity high load multiple plane and unpredictable

When designing rehabilitation or conditioning programmes coaches and rehabilitators must never lose sight of the specific demands imposed by the sport including the ability to exhibit rapid and coordinated responses to the ever-changing environments For comparison of approaches to rehabilitation see Table 137 and Figure 1316

# Introduction

Nutrition is major consideration for athletes coaches and rehabilitators and plays crucial role in training competition and in the prevention and management of sports injuries So what is sports nutrition? Sports nutrition encompasses what when and how much athletes eat It takes account of how nutrients are digested and absorbed and how foods are metabolised for energy or assimilated into tissues

Correct nutrition or more specifically the optimal balance of energy and nutrients delivered at the right time has range of potential benefits for the athlete These include: recuperation from and adaptation to training; the maintenance of work-rate throughout match race or training session; the maintenance of concentration and coordination; the maintenance of composition; and provision of an optimum environment for injuries to heal Without correct nutrition all of these processes are affected with associated detriments to training performance injury risk and injury rehabilitation

During this chapter you will learn about:

- Fundamentals of nutrition
- Energy balance
- The nutrients and how to obtain them
- The importance of balanced diet for health and performance
- Energy requirements for specific sports
- Nutritional strategies for optimal performance and the evidence to support them
- Nutritional strategies for injury prevention
- Nutrition for the injured athlete

# Fundamentals of Nutrition

# Energy Balance

Food and drink provide energy Complex chemical processes break down food to provide essential fuels for range of functions including breathing blood circulation chemical reactions growth repair brain function and muscular activity

Managing energy balance is nutritional priority for athletes Food must provide adequate energy for training and competition but must not provide excess An excess of energy over and above that expended will lead to weight gain This may be in

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Energy In vs Energy Out

Energy balance: No weight gain no weight loss

Positive energy balance: Weight gain

Negative energy balance: Weight loss

The of functional muscle tissue in the case of an athlete training for increased muscle hypertrophy strength and power but more commonly may also be in the of unwanted fat for example when an injured athlete is forced to stop training but maintains the same high-energy diet By contrast diet that has insufficient energy will lead to weight loss This may be the case in sports that require high volume of training such as triathlon where athletes may struggle to consume enough energy to meet the demands of training

To maintain weight and composition at the optimal level for sport athletes must therefore manage both the amount of energy they consume and the amount they expend This is called managing the energy balance

Energy balance can be summarised by the following:

- If athletes consume more energy than they use then they will gain weight – hypercaloric diet
- If athletes consume as much energy as they use then they will stay the same weight – isocaloric diet
- If athletes consume less energy than they use then they will lose weight – hypocaloric diet

# Energy and Calories

Energy is measured in Joules; however the term most often used in dietetics and amongst athletes is the kcal (one kcal equals 42 kJoules) To maintain energy balance the estimated average energy intakes required in ‘healthy’ adults are 2550 kcal/day for males and 1940 kcal/day for females (FSA 2008) Additional physical activity needs however are not accounted for in these estimated average requirements Therefore athletes in training will have higher energy requirements which will increase in proportion to the volume of training that the athlete performs

# Nutrients and Where to Get Them

In addition to energy food and drink provide nutrients These are the raw materials or ingredients required by the for optimal health and function There are six key nutrient classes:

Carbohydrates
Fats
Proteins
Vitamins
Minerals
Water
---
# Fundamentals of Nutrition

Each of these nutrient classes has specialised roles within the that are essential for health and optimal performance An inadequate intake of any of these will result in disease or impaired physical and cognitive functioning which can normally only be prevented by the nutrient Of these nutrients carbohydrates fats and proteins provide energy Water vitamins and minerals provide no energy but play vital role in the regulation of processes Alcohol is considered by some to be the seventh nutrient as it also provides source of energy but it is not essential

The correct nutrient balance will help athletes remain healthy and perform optimally Too much or too little of any one nutrient will affect both health and performance

# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the single most important source of energy for athletes They provide approximately four kcal per gram and are the primary fuel source for high intensity exercise (above 60% VO2 max) (Coggan and Coyle 1988; Carter et al 2003)

Carbohydrates can be classified as simple and complex

Simple carbohydrates are found in sugary foods such as fruit fruit juices sugar and honey and generally provide quick but short-lasting source of energy These can be further divided into: monosaccharides which are simple one-unit sugars such as glucose fructose and galactose; and disaccharides which are formed from two monosaccharides For example sucrose – or common sugar – is combination of glucose and fructose

Complex carbohydrates are found in starchy foods such as pasta rice potatoes bread vegetables cereals beans and pulses and provide stable supply of longer-term energy Complex carbohydrates can be further divided into: polysaccharides (containing more than two monosaccharides) which include starch (from plant sources) and glycogen (from animals) and dietary fibre (non-starch polysaccharide) which is found in plant foods cereal fruit and vegetables and is crucial to optimal health

Foods and in particular carbohydrates can also be classified by their glycaemic index The glycaemic index (GI) is measure of the extent to which certain food raises blood glucose (Jenkins et al 1981) High GI foods such as white bread potatoes cornflakes and jelly beans cause sharp rise in blood glucose which is often short lasting and followed by rebound drop in blood glucose Low GI foods such as porridge high-fibre cereal beans peanuts and apricots which are high in fibre and/or protein give slower but more sustained release of glucose causing slower rise in blood glucose and no rebound drop

For the healthy population carbohydrates should contribute approximately 50–60% of the energy intake in the diet with low GI high-fibre complex carbohydrates providing the majority of this requirement (Salmeron et al 1997; Foster-Powell et al 2002) This should increase to approximately 60–70% in an athletic population

# Protein

Protein plays vital role in the maintenance of all tissues It is used as the structural basis of all cells forms the contractile components of muscle and is used to synthesise haemoglobin enzymes hormones neurotransmitters and antibodies helping to maintain the immune system and regulate all essential chemical reactions Protein which contains approximately 4 kcal/gram is also used as an energy source supplying about 5–10% of energy expenditure (Dohn 1986; Brooks and Mercies 1994)

Proteins are made up of amino acids and it is these amino acids that are the real building blocks of the There are 20 amino acids 12 of which can be synthesised from other amino acids and are considered non-essential and eight (nine for children) that are considered essential as they cannot be made within the and therefore must come from the diet

Protein is found in variety of foods however not all foods contain all of the essential amino acids Those that do contain all the essential amino acids are termed complete proteins which can be found in animal products such as meat fish poultry eggs milk and yogurt as well as soya Incomplete proteins have one or more of the essential amino acids missing These are usually found in plant foods such as beans pulses vegetables grains and rice In order to get all of the essential amino acids athletes should either aim to eat complete proteins such as those gained from animal sources or combine other proteins to ensure that their essential amino acid needs are met

The recommended intake of protein for healthy sedentary person is 075g/kg weight/day or approximately 15% of the diet (FSA 2008)

# Fat

Fat has many essential functions within the that include:

- Energy provision
- Formation of cell membranes and nerve fibres
- Protection of vital organs
- Production of hormones
- Storage and transport of fat-soluble vitamins
- Insulation
- Suppression of hunger
- Adding palatability to foods

The can store large amounts of energy as fat mostly in the of subcutaneous adipose tissue which can be mobilised and transported to the working muscles as fuel source during exercise but also as intramuscular fat where it is more readily utilised within the muscles

Fat contains approximately 9 kcal/gram making it very efficient way for the to store large amounts of energy High fat foods are therefore considered energy dense making it easy for athletes to inadvertently consume too much energy from these foods Managing fat intake is therefore primary concern for athletes to prevent any unwanted increase in fat

Athletes should also consider the type of fat in the diet Naturally occurring dietary fat can be either unsaturated or saturated:

- Unsaturated fatty acids: Contain one (monounsaturated) or more (polyunsaturated) double bonds between carbon atoms where each double bond replaces two hydrogen atoms Generally liquid at room temperature and found in plant sources and fish
- Saturated fatty acids: Contain no double bonds Tend to be solid at room temperature and come from animal sources Associated with increased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol) and an increased risk of coronary heart disease

Trans-fatty acids are formed by process called hydrogenation Vegetable oils are chemically changed to give them higher melting point effectively making them more solid at room temperature and are used in the manufacture of margarine and other spreads When unsaturated fatty acids are altered and acquire some of the properties of saturated fatty acids through hydrogenation they are termed trans-fatty acids

All fats contain mixture of fatty acid types but it is the proportion of different fatty acids that makes some fats healthier than others Fats associated with raised cholesterol levels and heart disease include those high in saturated animal fats (red meat butter cream lard) and trans-fatty acids from hydrogenated vegetable oils (baked goods and some margarines) Fats with greater protective effect include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in olive oil and oily fish

While most fatty acids can be synthesised within the there are two that are essential: linolenic (omega-3) and linoleic (omega-6) fatty acids Omega-3 fatty acids in particular are associated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system Linolenic fatty acids are found in oily fish and range of vegetable oils such as sunflower and sesame Linoleic fatty acids are found in most plant oils especially corn and soybean oil

Current guidelines for fat intake in healthy diet recommend no more than 30% of energy intake as total fat and less than 10% as saturated fat

Athletes should aim to avoid or reduce their intake of the following high fat foods:

- Cake
- Biscuits
- Chocolate
- Fat on meat
- Sausages
- Pasties
- Pies
- Beef burgers
- Cheese
- Butter
- Cream

Moreover athletes should aim to get the majority of their fat intake from oily fish white fish vegetable seeds and oils soybeans and nuts

# Vitamins

Vitamins are essential organic molecules that cannot be synthesised in the Although they are only required in very small quantities deficiency can lead to symptoms of disease Vitamins have range of specific functions that are essential for health including:

- Absorption of nutrients
- Antioxidants and protection of cell membranes
- Energy metabolism
- Catalysts for and regulation of chemical reactions
- Collagen synthesis

There are 13 compounds commonly identified as vitamins that are broadly categorised as either water-soluble or fat-soluble

# Summary of Nutrient Requirements

Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the B-complex They cannot be stored within the and must therefore be consumed regularly Any excess intake is normally excreted in the urine

Vitamin B refers to host of different vitamins that play an essential role in the release of energy from carbohydrates fat and protein and the formation of haemoglobin They are known as the B-complex and include thiamine (B1) riboflavin (B2) pantothenic acid niacin (B3) pyridoxine (B6) folic acid cyanocobalamin (B12) and biotin Deficiencies can lead to fatigue gastrointestinal problems heart failure and nervous disorders (FSA 2008) Vitamin B is found in grains milk products eggs green vegetables fish liver nuts and wholegrain and fortified cereals

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) works as an antioxidant and is essential for collagen synthesis protein metabolism wound healing functioning of the immune system and iron absorption Deficiencies can lead to poor immune function poor wound healing and scurvy Good sources of Vitamin C include citrus fruits tomatoes and green vegetables

Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A D E and K These are stored in the and can accumulate in fatty tissue Excessive intakes may accumulate to toxic levels

Vitamin A (retinol and beta-carotene) has many roles It is an important antioxidant and is essential for vision immune function bone health and gene transcription Deficiency leads to vision impairments particularly night blindness Excess can become toxic and lead to numerous problems that could include birth defects kidney problems nausea hair loss headache irritability susceptibility to infection fissures of the lips blurred vision bone and joint pains muscle pain and weakness (FSA 2003) While it is not possible to establish Safe Upper Limit for vitamin A total intakes above 1500 micrograms should be avoided (FSA 2003) Good sources of vitamin A include liver kidney milk and eggs Good sources of beta-carotene ( precursor to vitamin A) include green leafy vegetables and carrots

Vitamin D plays central role in the absorption and regulation of both calcium and phosphorus and is therefore essential for optimum bone health Deficiency can lead to rickets osteomalacia and osteoporosis Vitamin D is synthesized by the skin in response to UV exposure but can also be gained from foods such as fish eggs fortified dairy products and breakfast cereals

Vitamin E refers to group of antioxidants that prevent cell membrane damage by reacting with radicals produced by lipid peroxidation Vitamin E is found in seeds nuts green leafy vegetables avocado olives and vegetable oils

Vitamin K is primarily responsible for blood clotting A deficiency is associated with severe and uncontrolled bleeding malformation of developing bone and cartilage calcification The main dietary sources include green leafy vegetables avocado and kiwifruit

# Minerals

Minerals have several major roles including the formation of bones and teeth formation of haemoglobin and hormones muscular contractility neural conductivity regulation of acid-base balance and metabolism Some minerals occur in the in relatively large amounts These are known as the major minerals and include: calcium phosphorus sulphur potassium chlorine sodium magnesium zinc and iron Other minerals occur in minute quantities These are called trace minerals and include: chromium cobalt copper fluorine iodine manganese molybdenum nickel selenium silicon tin and vanadium

Deficiencies of any mineral can lead to signs and symptoms of disease Moderate excesses of sodium potassium calcium and chlorine are normally excreted by the kidneys whereas excess intakes of other minerals can be harmful or impair absorption of other micronutrients (eg excess calcium inhibits absorption of iron and zinc; excess zinc inhibits absorption of copper)

In general balanced diet that contains variety of foodstuffs and includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables should provide sufficient quantities of the minerals required for optimal health
---
# Fundamentals of Nutrition

# Minerals for Athletes

Two of the most important minerals for athletes are iron and calcium

# Iron

Iron is an essential element which is required for oxygen transport (haemoglobin and myoglobin) and electron transport It is found in the diet in two forms: haem iron and non-haem iron Haem iron is generally found in animal foods and has greater bioavailability (10–35%) Non-haem iron generally found in plant foods has low bioavailability (2–10%) (Zijp et al 2000)

Low iron levels can be due to inadequate diet malabsorption or increased iron losses To ensure an adequate iron intake athletes should eat variety of foods including red meat and green leafy vegetables Iron absorption can be enhanced by the presence of vitamin C Excessive intakes of iron are associated with gastrointestinal disorders including constipation nausea vomiting and diarrhoea whilst chronic excess may lead to high iron stores and increased risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer (FSA 2003) The FSA Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (2003) suggest that for most people an intake of approximately 17 mg/day would not be expected to produce adverse effects

# Calcium

Calcium is another essential mineral for health and sports performance It forms an integral part of bone structure muscle contraction blood clotting and transmission of nerve impulses A deficiency can lead to rickets reduced bone mineral density osteoporosis and problems with blood clotting

The best dietary sources of calcium are milk and milk products and green leafy vegetables Overall absorption is generally poor and requires adequate vitamin D (FSA 2003)

# Water

Water is by far the most important nutrient It accounts for 50–75% of weight depending on fat content with fat tissue containing approximately 20% water lean tissue approximately 75% and blood around 95% Water has many crucial roles including temperature control (sweating) lubrication (brain eyes spinal cord and digestive system) solvent for all biochemical reactions and the transportation of nutrients and oxygen to and carbon dioxide and other metabolic waste products away from the working muscles For optimal cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function athletes must therefore maintain sufficient fluid levels and avoid dehydration which results in decrease in both cardiovascular (Gonzalez-Alonso et al 1997) and strength and power performance (Jones et al 2008) Water is gained from drink food and metabolic reactions and is lost through urine faeces expired air and sweat

# Alcohol

Alcohol is non-essential nutrient that has range of negative effects for athletes It causes intoxication affects skill and coordination leads to dehydration de-motivates inhibits recovery lowers testosterone and provides an energy source (7 kcal/gram) that can only be utilized once it has been deposited as fat Overall alcohol is highly detrimental to sporting performance significantly reducing aerobic performance capacity for several hours after consumption (O’Brien and Lyons 2000; El-Sayed et al 2005) Alcohol also acts as diuretic and therefore may result in dehydration

# Summary of Micronutrients

The importance of balanced diet: For optimal health and performance it is essential that athletes get the right quantities and balance of all the nutrients There are several tools and guidelines to ensure the correct quantities and balance of nutrients for health The most common tool is the reference nutrient intake (RNI) which is the amount of nutrient required to maintain adequate health for the majority of the population RNIs are provided for energy protein vitamins and minerals The advantages of using RNIs are that they give individuals starting point to judge their diet in relation to balanced intake

Use sparingly: Sweets Fats oils

4-7 servings: Meat poultry fish beans eggs nuts milk yogurt cheese

4-8 servings: Bread cereal rice pasta potatoes

Unlimited: Vegetables

3-5 servings: Fruit

Water: 8-12 servings

Healthy population guidelines (RNIs) do not account for the individual needs of athletes which are determined by the individual the sport and the level of training For athletes diet that is adequate for health may not be optimal for performance due to increased energy expenditure

The current UK government guidelines for health suggest balance of approximately 55% carbohydrates 15% protein and less than 30% fat (with saturated fat accounting for less than 10%) (FSA 2008) These recommendations serve as good starting point for athletes but modifications may be necessary based on various circumstances such as the sport activity levels size weight goals and training type

The food guide pyramid is common tool to help individuals achieve healthy balance of foods within their diet It illustrates the proportion and type of foods that contribute to healthy balanced diet At the base of the pyramid are carbohydrate-based foods along with requirements for fruit and vegetables The pyramid reflects the percentage guidelines for macronutrients in healthy diet Several alternative versions of the pyramid exist to support specific groups (Painter et al 2002)

# Nutrition for Performance

Optimal nutrition for performance is determined by what when and how much an athlete eats A diet that is adequate for health is not usually optimal for performance For example athletes require more energy greater quantities of certain nutrients (carbohydrates protein) and need to consume food at key times before during and after training or competition

# Energy Requirements for Specific Sports/Training Activities

Energy requirements for athletes are determined by their size basal metabolic rate and the extra energy required for activities performed throughout the day (training and competition) as well as recovery
---
# Nutrition for Performance

# NUTRITION FOR PERFORMANCE

Adaptation from training and competition and whether the athlete is trying to gain or lose weight Mean total daily energy expenditures vary between different athletes For example:

- Male boxers (57Kg) expend 2900 kcal;
- Male weightlifters (110Kg) 4900 kcal;
- Female basketball players (614Kg) 3100 kcal (Ismail et al 1997)

Male cross-country skiers (during periods of hard training) use around 8600 kcal/day (Sjodin et al 1994)

Professional road cyclists expend over 6000 kcal per day throughout the three-week Tour de France event and use in excess of 9000 kcal per day during hard mountain stages (Saris et al 1989) This is reflected by high reported energy intakes (in excess of 5450 kcal) during training and competition (García-Rovés et al 2000)

In team sports differences in activity levels will also vary with playing position resulting in large variations in energy expenditure between individuals on the same team which must be matched by energy intake For example Lundy et al (2006) report that elite professional rugby league players consume between 2700 and 6900 kcal/day (mean 4230 kcal/day) depending on size and position although it is worth noting that this is ‘normative’ data and this level of consumption may not necessarily be optimal In fact Lundy et al (2006) recommended that these athletes increase their energy intake through additional carbohydrate consumption

# Macronutrient Requirements for Performance

Energy needs are met from carbohydrate fat and protein The balance of use between these fuels at any one time depends on the intensity and duration of exercise At the exercise intensities normally encountered during training and competition carbohydrate is usually the primary energy substrate To optimise performance athletes need to consume the right fuels at the right time

# Carbohydrate Requirements for Performance

The selection of fuel for muscular work is directly related to the intensity of effort; the higher the intensity the greater the reliance on carbohydrate as substrate (see Figure 143) (Romjin et al 1993) As most sports are performed at high intensities carbohydrate becomes the primary source of energy

In the carbohydrate is stored primarily as muscle and liver glycogen Carbohydrate stores however are limited to approximately 450g of muscle glycogen (with range from 50g after exhaustive exercise to approximately 900g in large well-trained well-rested and well-fed athlete (Jeukendrup 2003 de Jonge and Smith 2008) 100–120g of liver glycogen and 5g of circulating blood glucose Just 2–3 hours of high-intensity activity may be enough to completely deplete these relatively limited glycogen reserves (Coyle et al 1986) The status of the glycogen stores before activity therefore will determine the duration that high-intensity exercise can be maintained (Astrand and Rodahl 1986) It is therefore important that for endurance activities (Coyle et al 1986) and high-intensity

# Calculating Energy Needs

Energy needs can be calculated by the following formula:

Energy EAR (estimated average requirement) = BMR (basal metabolic rate) × PAL (Physical Activity Level)

PAL refers to the ratio of total energy required over 24 hours to the BMR over 24 hours For example PAL of 14 represents very low activity levels 16 represents moderate activity levels and 19 represents high activity levels Most athletes will have PAL of 19 or above

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Muscle Glycogen and Energy Expenditure

During intermittent activities (Balsom et al 1999) athletes aim to optimise their glycogen stores Depending on the intensity and volume of training this is normally achieved with an intake of 5–13g/kgbw/day (see Table 144) (Jeukendrup and Gleeson 2004)

# Pre-Exercise Considerations

To delay fatigue and enhance performance athletes should optimise muscle glycogen stores pre-exercise (Astrand and Rodahl 1986) Glycogen stores must be sufficient to allow completion of the event at the highest possible intensity It is important to distinguish between maximal and optimal storage of glycogen For events where glycogen depletion becomes limiting factor for performance (eg the marathon soccer match) it is desirable to maximise stores prior to the race or game For shorter events such as 10K race maximising glycogen stores may not be desirable due to the additional weight from excess glycogen storage which can inhibit performance Athletes should therefore only seek to ‘carbo-load’ for sports where glycogen depletion may become limiting factor in performance

# Carbohydrate Loading

Athletes can maximise muscle glycogen stores through carbohydrate loading regime (see Table 143) There are several protocols for doing this Early research suggested athletes should perform an exhaustive bout or bouts of exercise followed by 3-4 days of very low carbohydrate intake or very low carbohydrate/high fat intake followed finally by 3-4 days of extremely high carbohydrate intake (Ahlborg et al 1967; Bergstrom et al 1967) Although this did increase muscle glycogen stores athletes were reluctant to train so hard and felt lethargic and irritable just few days before competition

A later and more widely adopted protocol involved tapering training over seven-day period and increasing consumption of carbohydrate for three days before the race (Sherman et al 1981) The advantage of this method was that athletes benefited from increased glycogen stores without the negative side effects Most glycogen loading protocols used by athletes and researchers involve the Sherman et al (1981) protocol or variations thereof (Madsen et al 1990; Widrick et al 1993; Burke et al 2000; James et al 2001)

More recently even higher glycogen levels have been achieved by the inclusion of 3-minute intense bout of training (150s of cycling at 130% of VO2 peak followed by 30s of all-out cycling) 24 hours before the event

Days 5–3 before the next match
To maintain stores during training – consume 7–10g/kgbw/day

From 2 days before the match
To ensure optimal levels of muscle glycogen prior to the next game – consume 10g/kgbw/day

Before the event athletes should consume high-glycaemic index carbohydrates (Fairchild et al 2002) The main advantage of this protocol is not just that higher glycogen levels are reached but that they are achieved in much shorter time-frame (24 hours) and do not necessarily require an extended period of tapering While there may be obvious advantages for athletes competing regularly particularly team sport athletes there is limited evidence supporting this method in practical settings compared to Sherman et al (1981) The potential negative effects of 3-minute intense bout 24 hours before competition are not yet fully understood

Liver glycogen stores are particularly sensitive to dietary carbohydrate intake and can be depleted by overnight fasting To replenish liver glycogen stores athletes should eat breakfast and/or consume pre-competition meal such as 150–300g of moderate GI carbohydrate

# During Exercise

While the benefits of pre-competition carbohydrate loading are well established there is also clear evidence for an ergogenic effect of carbohydrate feeding during an event (Coggan and Coyle 1991) Rather than reducing the rate of glycogen utilization (Bergstrom et al 1967; Tsintzas et al 1996) carbohydrate ingestion appears to maintain blood glucose levels late in exercise thus maintaining carbohydrate oxidation and performance during endurance exercise (Coyle et al 1986; Coggan and Coyle 1991) Carbohydrate ingestion also improves endurance performance during intermittent high-intensity running in athletes with already high pre-exercise muscle glycogen concentrations (Foskett et al 2008) and should therefore be considered an essential practice for team sport athletes

# Carbohydrate Feeding During Exercise

Carbohydrate feeding during exercise is often best achieved through the use of sports drinks or carbohydrate gels These are palatable convenient to take and generally tolerated well by athletes Sports drinks typically contain around 60g of carbohydrate per litre which is close to the maximum amount of exogenous carbohydrate that the can absorb and oxidise per hour (1-11g/min) (Jeukendrup and Jentjens 2000; Wallis et al 2007; Jeukendrup 2008)

For longer events athletes can carry small snacks of easily digested high-carbohydrate foods (eg sports gels jelly-beans jam sandwiches) To identify what they like and what they can tolerate athletes should practice eating and drinking during training

Depending on the priority (fluid delivery or carbohydrate delivery) athletes can vary the concentration of carbohydrate in the sports drink For example:

- A 5% solution will be more appropriate for those athletes wishing to replenish both water and carbohydrate
- A 10% solution will be more suited to carbohydrate delivery at the expense of gastric emptying (Maughan 1991); however during exercise this may result in gastrointestinal distress in some individuals

It is often difficult for team sport athletes to consume food or fluid during the game Players and support teams must be organised and proactive during any stoppages time-outs injury breaks and half-times as these breaks provide the perfect opportunity to consume an isotonic carbohydrate-based drink

# Post-Exercise

To enhance recovery and provide the fuel for the next match or training session athletes must restore their muscle glycogen stores as soon as possible post-exercise If glycogen stores are low at the start of the next training session muscle glycogen and overall carbohydrate utilisation will be reduced lowering the exercise intensity that can be maintained

The rate and extent of glycogen re-synthesis is dependent on the quantity timing and type of carbohydrate ingestion and on the nature of recovery (Maughan et al 1997)

# How Much?

Glycogen re-synthesis depends on the quantity of dietary carbohydrate consumed To replenish glycogen stores athletes should consume at least:

- 1g/kg weight immediately post-exercise (Ivy 1998)
- A minimum of 1–185g/kg weight of carbohydrate per hour in the first few hours post-exercise (Jentjens and Jeukendrup 2003)
- Maintain daily intake of 5–7g/kg weight/day during periods of moderate training (1–2 hours per day)
- 7–10g/kg weight/day when training load is increased (2–3 hours per day)
- 10–13g per kg/day during periods of hard or prolonged training (over 3 hours per day) (Jeukendrup and Gleeson 2004)

# When?

Due to elevated enzyme activity (glycogen synthase) (Sherman et al 1983; Doyle et al 1993) and cell membrane permeability the highest rates of muscle glycogen synthesis occur when athletes consume large amounts of carbohydrate (10–185 g/kg weight/hour) immediately post-exercise followed by further feeding at 15–60 minute intervals thereafter for up to 6-hours post-exercise (Ivy 1998; Jentjens and Jeukendrup 2003)

When carbohydrate feeding is delayed lower rates of muscle glycogen synthesis will occur (Jentjens and Jeukendrup 2003) Therefore to facilitate glycogen resynthesis athletes should consume carbohydrates as soon as possible post-exercise

# What?

High glycaemic index snacks (eg jaffa cakes jelly beans toast and jam) and in particular carbohydrate-based drinks are convenient easily and more rapidly absorbed and digested and will provide sufficient carbohydrate until consumption of larger meal In order to maintain the high level of carbohydrate intake and glycogen resynthesis the post-exercise meal should be based around complex carbohydrates such as pasta rice or potatoes

# Type of Recovery

Passive recovery appears to be more effective strategy to optimise glycogen resynthesis particularly in type I muscle fibres (Choi et al 1994; Fairchild et al 2003)

# Carbohydrates and Protein

Although some studies have shown enhanced glycogen resynthesis when carbohydrate feedings are

# Nutrition for Performance

# NUTRITION FOR PERFORMANCE

# Key Points

- Athletes should aim to optimise glycogen levels pre-exercise via breakfast and pre-exercise meal (low-moderate GI carbohydrates) See below for examples
- During exercise consume up to 70g/hour to maintain carbohydrate oxidation and exercise intensity (sports drinks easily digestible snacks see the below for examples)
- Consume high glycaemic index and easily digested carbohydrates immediately post-exercise (1-185g/kgbw)
- Consume 1g/kgbw high glycaemic index carbohydrates within the next 2 hours post-exercise

# Fat as Fuel for Exercise

Whilst high-intensity exercise is fuelled predominantly by carbohydrate at lower intensities or late in prolonged exercise fat becomes increasingly important (Klein et al 1994; Horowitz and Klein 2000) In contrast to limited carbohydrate stores fat stores are large with an average person storing over 100000 kcal of energy as fat mainly as subcutaneous adipose tissue Due to limits in the fat oxidation process however these stores cannot be fully utilised for exercise There are several steps involved in the oxidation of fat for energy:

1 Lipolysis where stored fat must be broken down to fatty acids for transport around the 
2 Transport of fatty acids in the bloodstream to the muscle cell
3 Transport of fatty acids across the cell membrane and to the mitochondria for oxidation

The slow rate at which these processes occur is key limiting factor for athletes and why carbohydrate which is readily available for oxidation is the primary fuel for high-intensity exercise

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Fuel Contribution

The relative contribution of fat for fuel depends on both the intensity and duration of exercise and whether carbohydrate has been consumed

# Intensity

At rest the majority of our fuel requirements come from fat As exercise intensity rises the rate of lipolysis and oxidation increase to maximum at approximately 64% VO2 max (Achten et al 2002) At higher exercise intensities (approximately 86–89% of VO2 max) the contribution of fat oxidation to energy expenditure is negligible (Achten et al 2002; Achten and Jeukendrup 2003) probably due to the restricted transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria via limited blood flow to subcutaneous tissue and lactate accumulation (Coyle et al 1997)

# Duration

As exercise progresses fat oxidation plays an increasingly important role As liver and muscle glycogen stores decrease the ’s ability to oxidise carbohydrate is depleted and fat becomes the dominant fuel with an associated drop in exercise intensity (not ideal during competition)

# Carbohydrate Intake

Carbohydrate consumption also appears to decrease fat oxidation (Horowitz et al 1997) Therefore pre-exercise meal that is high in carbohydrate will reduce fat oxidation Despite this suppression of fat oxidation the overall aim is to increase carbohydrate oxidation and therefore pre-exercise carbohydrate intake should be paramount

# Increasing Fat Oxidation

To enhance the use of fat as an energy source and therefore save glycogen stores athletes can adopt several practices Endurance training is the most effective increasing the rate of lipid metabolism through increased size and number of muscle mitochondria increased activity of lipid oxidising enzymes and increased intra-muscular triacylglycerol stores (Coyle 1995; Phillips et al 1996) Evidence for dietary manipulation of fat intake to enhance fat oxidation however is inconclusive with high-fat diets and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides failing to show any significant ergogenic benefit (Hawley et al 1998; Hawley 2002) Whilst caffeine ingestion has been shown to increase endurance performance usually attributed to an increased level of lipid oxidation (Ivy et al 1979) it is still unclear whether this is due to enhanced fat metabolism (Graham 2001)

# Summary/Key Points

- Fat stores in humans are much larger than carbohydrate stores and provide an important source of fuel for exercise
- Fat oxidation is limited by the steps in the oxidation process
- Fat oxidation increases with exercise intensity up to 60–65% VO2 max At higher intensities fat oxidation is restricted
- Carbohydrate feeding reduces lipolysis and fatty acid availability which inhibits fat oxidation and increases carbohydrate usage
- Manipulation of fat in the diet via high fat diets or medium chain triglycerides has limited benefit for performance

# Protein Requirements for Performance

Do athletes need more protein than non-athletes? While the current UK RNI for protein is 075g/kg weight per day (FSA 2008) there are several mechanisms by which athletes could require more These include: increased oxidation of amino acids during exercise increased proteolysis as an acute response to exercise and increased protein synthesis as an adaptation to training

For endurance and intermittent sprint sports protein requirements may be increased due to increased content of mitochondrial proteins and increased involvement in oxidative metabolism To account for this an intake of 12–14g/kg weight per day is generally recommended for endurance athletes (Lemon 1995) Consistent levels of high intensity/high volume training where high levels of amino acid oxidation occur may increase protein requirements for endurance athletes to 16 g/kg weight per day (Tarnopolsky 2004; Campbell et al 2007) with extreme endurance

Athletes may require protein intake of up to 20 g/kgbw/day due to their inability to consume adequate levels of carbohydrates throughout the day Endurance athletes should aim for an intake of 14–16 g/kgbw/day For strength and power sports protein requirements may increase to 17–20 g/kgbw/day especially during initial stages of resistance training

Excess dietary proteins cannot be stored in the ; they are oxidized and nitrogen is excreted Generally protein intake increases with energy intake and balanced high-energy diet is likely to meet protein needs without supplementation A balanced diet should include meat fish dairy products cereals nuts and beans Vegetarian athletes can consider alternative protein sources like Quorn™ However athletes with restricted diets may risk insufficient protein intake particularly endurance athletes and those in weight category or aesthetic sports

# Timing of Protein Intake

# Pre-exercise

Athletes should aim to create an anti-catabolic environment prior to exercise Research indicates that consuming essential amino acids plus carbohydrates pre-exercise can increase net amino acid uptake A protein-based snack (approximately 10g) before resistance training is recommended such as milk yogurt or tuna sandwich

# Post-exercise

Results regarding post-exercise protein ingestion are mixed but there seems to be benefit in consuming protein and carbohydrate-based snack/drink immediately after exercise This can help create an anabolic environment Examples include milkshakes yogurt with banana cereals with milk or sandwich with protein filling A protein-based drink like milkshake is often convenient for quick absorption post-exercise and should contain adequate carbohydrates (75–90g)

# Throughout the Day

Increased protein intake leads to heightened activity of enzymes responsible for oxidizing protein Enzyme activity rises quickly after large protein meal but takes longer to down-regulate Therefore larger meals can lead to greater levels of protein oxidation To ensure protein is consistently available for growth regular intake is essential

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

To support muscle repair and prevent preferential oxidation athletes should consume small quantities of protein regularly throughout the day

# Summary and Practical Recommendations

- Protein requirements vary depending on the sport training and the individual
- Endurance athletes should consume 12–20g/kgbw/day depending on the volume of training
- Intermittent sport athletes should consume 14–16g/kgbw/day
- Strength athletes should consume 17–2g/kgbw/day
- Eat small quantities at each meal not all in one go
- Consume protein from variety of sources to ensure balance between essential and non-essential amino acids (complete proteins from animal sources will provide all essential amino acids)
- Prior to resistance training consume protein-based snack
- Immediately post resistance training consume protein-based snack
- Protein intake above the recommended levels (12–20g/kgbw/day) is not necessary for most athletes
- Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake – the will use increased levels of protein in glycogen-depleted state

# Calculating Macronutrient Requirements for Different Sports

The tables below show the different nutritional intakes by different athletes The examples provide useful reference point for athletes The practical implications of food intake during training or competition may affect the consumption of each macronutrient and the overall balance

# Example Nutritional Intake for Tour de France Cyclist

|Nutrient|Quantity|Total|% Daily Energy Intake|
|---|---|---|---|
|Carbohydrate|13g/kgbw/day|975|699|
|Protein|20g/kgbw/day|150|108|
|Fat|120g/day|120|193|
|Total| |5580|100|

For example Tour de France cyclist may find it difficult to achieve the 13g/kgbw/day required to maintain performance which necessitates large quantities of easily digestible carbohydrates delivered throughout the ride requiring considerable logistical support before during and after each stage

# Example Nutritional Intake for Rugby League Player

|Nutrient|Quantity|Total|% Daily Energy Intake|
|---|---|---|---|
|Carbohydrate|8g/kgbw/day|800|64|
|Protein|18g/kgbw/day|180|144|
|Fat|120g/day|120|216|
|Total| |5000|100|

# Fluid for Performance

Adequate hydration and the maintenance of fluid balance are crucial for performance During exercise 75–80% of the energy used by the muscles appears as heat The greater the intensity of exercise the greater the heat produced This heat is dissipated through the evaporation of sweat and it is possible to lose up to 25 litres per hour during intense activity

# Nutrition for Performance

# NUTRITION FOR PERFORMANCE

# Fluid Loss and Dehydration

Fluid losses during exercise can be significant with studies showing losses up to 31 litres during 90-minute soccer training session in the heat (Casa et al 2000; Shirreffs et al 2005) and 265 litres in cooler environments (Maughan et al 2005) Dehydration contributes to fatigue and hyperthermia during exercise (González-Alonso et al 1997) with distance runners (5000 and 10000m) experiencing pace reduction of more than 6% following 2% loss of weight due to dehydration (Armstrong et al 1985) This effect is exacerbated in hot environments or during prolonged events However single bout sprint and power performance does not seem to be negatively affected by dehydration (Watson et al 2005)

Dehydration also impairs coordination and increases the risk of injury Changes in water content (as little as 2% of weight) can severely affect physical psychomotor and cognitive performance (Grandjean and Grandjean 2007) potentially increasing the risk of injury Therefore it is crucial for athletes to maintain fluid levels and avoid dehydration making fluid intake key factor in delaying fatigue during exercise

# Fluid Intake During Exercise

Fluid intake during exercise offers several benefits including the prevention of dehydration maintenance of blood volume osmolality and viscosity (which ensures cardiac output and performance) and maintenance of skin blood flow and sweat rate (reducing the risk of hyperthermia and heat stress)

Despite these benefits most athletes do not drink enough water to prevent dehydration during physical activity (NATA Position Statement: Fluid Replacement for Athletes 2000) Shirreffs et al (2005) found that players replaced only 9 to 73% (average 45±16%) of the fluid lost through sweat during 90-minute training session in the heat Thirst is sign of dehydration but athletes can dehydrate by 2% of weight before feeling thirsty so it is essential to drink before thirst occurs

# Factors Affecting Fluid Intake

Several factors influence fluid intake during training and competition including:

- Availability of fluid
- Thirst
- Awareness of sweat losses
- Opportunity to drink
- Palatability of fluid

# Ideal Fluid for Exercise

Initially fluids should be cool (10–12°C) palatable non-acidic non-gassy and should not cause gastrointestinal distress Water fits this description and is good starting point However there are advantages to drinks that also contain carbohydrates (for energy and to maintain carbohydrate oxidation) salt (03–07g/l to aid fluid retention and stimulate thirst) (Casa et al 2000) and are isotonic (with an osmolality of 280–300 mOsm/kg to aid gastric emptying) Sports drinks typically contain mixture of water carbohydrates and salt benefiting athletes through quicker rehydration after training faster carbohydrate refueling stimulating thirst and being convenient and readily available

# Practical Recommendations

# What to Drink?

Athletes must determine whether the priority is to supply fluid or energy If fluid is the priority electrolyte solutions with 4–6% carbohydrates are effective (Murray et al 1999) If carbohydrates are prioritized more concentrated solution (6–10% carbohydrate) may be more beneficial However solutions over 8% may cause gastrointestinal distress (Shi et al 2004) Overall carbohydrate solutions in the 6–8% range provide an optimal balance of gastric emptying fluid absorption and carbohydrate delivery Athletes should experiment with varying concentrations during training to find what they can tolerate

# When to Drink?

This largely depends on the nature of the sport and the availability of fluid

# How Much to Drink?

This will depend on whether it is before during or after exercise on losses through sweat and on how much fluid the athlete can reasonably tolerate

# Prior to Exercise:

Athletes should drink sufficient quantities to ensure they are well hydrated

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Hydration Guidelines

Before exercise athletes should ensure they are well-hydrated with clear urine for several hours beforehand A drink of 500–600 ml 2–3 hours before exercise followed by another 200–300 ml 10–20 minutes before exercise begins (Casa et al 2000) will help achieve this Taking regular sips until the start may be useful way for athletes to consume these quantities For longer events where dehydration may inhibit performance athletes should drink an additional 400–600 ml of water (or carbohydrate solution) immediately before exercise It is important for athletes to experiment in training to ensure they can tolerate both the quantity and the type of drink

# During Exercise

During exercise athletes should drink 100–300 ml of water every 15 minutes as tolerated (Rehrer et al 1990) For team sports it is advisable to drink at halftime or during breaks in play Again athletes should practice drinking during training Adding carbohydrates and electrolytes as found in most popular sports drinks will ensure delivery of carbohydrate for oxidation and glycogen replenishment (during break) and electrolytes to aid retention

# After Exercise

The priority post-exercise is to replenish what was lost (both in terms of fluid and glycogen stores) Fluid intake needs to be about 150% of weight lost during exercise to achieve normal hydration within 6 hours post-exercise (Shirreffs et al 1996) Ingesting plain water is largely ineffective as it dilutes plasma and inhibits the secretion of anti-diuretic hormone Adding sodium (60–80 mmol/litre) will reduce urinary water loss aiding fluid retention and the recovery of fluid balance (Nose et al 1988; Sharp 2006) Moreover adding sodium will trigger thirst and promote drinking Cool fluids are more palatable Therefore to promote rapid recovery of fluid balance post-exercise athletes should focus on both volume of fluid (around 150% of weight loss) and sodium content (60–80 mmol/litre) The inclusion of carbohydrate (4–6%) will also help to restore glycogen stores

# Hydration for Team Sports

Team sports such as football rugby hockey and netball present another challenge Often athletes cannot consume fluid throughout the match or training session Therefore athletes need to ensure adequate hydration on days prior to match follow the pre-exercise fluid intake guidelines above aim to consume at least 500 ml at halftime and try to drink during any other breaks in play such as during injury breaks Post-match athletes should follow the guidelines above for rehydration post-exercise

# Carbohydrate versus Fluid Delivery

Carbohydrates provide the substrate for glycogen resynthesis and maintenance of blood glucose but there can be conflict with fluid absorption at higher carbohydrate concentrations If an athlete is dehydrated then fluid (and electrolyte) intake will be paramount A carbohydrate concentration of no more than 4–6% will ensure that gastric emptying is not affected If carbohydrate is the priority (either for oxidation or glycogen resynthesis) then higher levels up to about 10% may be consumed

# Summary/Key Points

- Start well hydrated Thirst is not an indicator of fluid need but sign of partial dehydration Athletes should consume fluids before they are thirsty
- To avoid dehydration drink about 500–600 ml in the hours before race/match and 200–300 ml 10–20 minutes beforehand Drink regularly throughout exercise (100–300 ml every 10–15 min)
- Carry fluids This will encourage voluntary fluid consumption
- Clear (pale yellow) urine is sign that the athlete is well hydrated; dark urine indicates under-hydration
- Avoid foods and drinks that may have diuretic effect (alcohol strong coffee)
- Estimate sweat loss for each athlete by measuring weight loss during training
- During exercise aim to drink sufficient fluids to match sweat loss
- Combine carbohydrates with fluid ingestion to help replenish glycogen stores

# Nutrition for Performance

# NUTRITION FOR PERFORMANCE

# Vitamin and Mineral Requirements for Athletes

Recommendations for micronutrient intake are largely based on the requirements of healthy but relatively inactive people During exercise it is likely that micronutrient requirements will increase (Whiting and Barabash 2006)

Micronutrient intake varies widely between individuals and groups with dietary surveys of athletes showing both high and low reported intakes of some vitamins and minerals leading to the possibility of long-term deficient diet or health problems associated with excess intakes Athlete groups that may be at risk of insufficient micronutrient intake include those on restricted energy intakes (Haymes 1991) vegetarians female athletes those involved in endurance or aesthetic sports and athletes in weight category sports In these groups consumption of multi-vitamin supplement may ensure adequate intakes and avoid deficiency (Beals and Manore 1998)

There is no clear evidence that elevated intakes of vitamins or minerals will increase performance and no evidence that athletes require significantly higher levels of micronutrients than non-athletes The priority therefore should be to avoid deficiency through the consumption of diet that is both sufficient and balanced

There are however several key micronutrients that either play pivotal role during exercise or are particularly prone to deficiency

# Vitamin B

Because vitamin B plays an essential role in the release of energy from carbohydrates fat and protein and in the formation of haemoglobin deficiency can have serious consequences for the athlete leading to fatigue and decreases in VO2 max and power (van der Beek et al 1994) Athletes at risk of possible deficiency may be those with restricted diets or vegans whereas athletes with an energy-rich diet are unlikely to be deficient Good sources of the B vitamins include meat fish milk eggs wholegrain cereals fortified breakfast cereals and some vegetables Although with balanced and energy-rich diet supplementation is generally unnecessary multi-vitamin will help meet requirements for athletes who may be unsure of their status

# Vitamin C and Antioxidants

Although there is no evidence that athletes need more vitamin C than non-athletes it is possible that antioxidant supplementation may decrease exercise-induced oxidative stress (Ji 1999; Morillas-Ruiz et al 2006) Overall athletes should avoid deficiency and obtain antioxidants via increased consumption of fruit and vegetables Large doses of single antioxidant compounds are not recommended

# Minerals and Exercise

Exercise is associated with increased losses of minerals in sweat and urine Iron calcium magnesium and zinc may be cause for concern in some athlete groups due to insufficient intakes and increased losses in sweat and urine Of these calcium and iron have the biggest impact on health and performance

# Iron

Iron depletion (low iron stores: low serum ferritin) is common in athletes (26% women 11% men - Malczewska et al 2001) but does not necessarily affect performance (Risser et al 1988) Iron deficiency without anaemia may however impair adaptation to endurance training (Brownlie et al 2004) in previously untrained women but can be corrected with iron supplementation Iron deficiency with anaemia (low haemoglobin) can impair work capacity and decrease exercise performance (Haas and Brownlie 2001)

Athletes at risk of iron deficiency include young athletes female athletes (Beard and Tobin 2000; Gropper et al 2006) athletes on low energy intakes (less than 300 kcal/day) athletes in weight category sports endurance athletes (Spodaryk 1993) vegetarians and athletes training in hot climates or at altitude

There are number of ways to increase iron:

1 Athletes should eat foods rich in haem-iron at least four times per week (eg liver lean red meat) as iron from these foods is readily absorbed
2 Vegetarians should aim to eat iron-fortified foods (eg breakfast cereal) and other non-haem iron food sources (eg dried fruit legumes green leafy vegetables)
---
# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

# Iron

Athletes can increase the absorption of iron from non-haem iron foods by consuming them with vitamin C-rich foods (eg orange juice) and avoiding tea at meals

# Calcium

Athletes with low energy intakes and who avoid dairy products may not meet their calcium requirements This is particular problem for female athletes on low energy intakes (Clarkson 1995) as amenorrhea may further hinder bone development and increase the risk of osteoporosis The current UK recommended daily intake of calcium is 700mg with an upper safe limit of 2500mg Calcium cannot be absorbed without Vitamin D (FSA 2008)

There are number of ways to increase calcium:

- Athletes should include three servings per day of low-fat dairy foods Include these in high carbohydrate meals (eg skimmed milk on cereal)
- Eat fish with bones (eg sardines tinned salmon)
- If athletes cannot tolerate dairy products then consider calcium-enriched soy products
- Eat green leafy vegetables (cabbage broccoli spinach)
- Supplementing calcium to 125% RNI helps maintain bone density when amenorrhea is present

# Summary

Maintaining adequate intakes of vitamins and minerals is essential for health and performance This can be achieved through varied and balanced diet Athletes who consume sufficient energy from balanced diet are unlikely to have vitamin and mineral deficiencies (Armstrong and Maresh 1996) however the use of multi-vitamin and mineral supplement for groups at risk or on low energy intakes may be appropriate

# Nutrition for Injury Prevention

# Delaying Fatigue

The most important nutritional consideration for injury prevention is in delaying the onset of fatigue If an athlete is fatigued there is change in running mechanics (Gerlach et al 2005; Kellis and Liassou 2009) landing mechanics (King et al 2005) decreased ability to maintain joint alignment control and appropriate muscular activation patterns during potentially risky manoeuvres (Wojtys et al 1996; Chappell et al 2005) an increased incidence of high-risk actions (Rahnama et al 2002) and an actual increase in injury occurrence towards the end of match or phase of play (Hawkins et al 2001) To limit fatigue athletes should consume diet that allows them to maintain optimal performance throughout the duration of race match or training session The two most important nutrients to prevent fatigue are carbohydrate and water

# Carbohydrate

One of the primary factors linking fatigue and injury is the level of muscle glycogen (Sherman and Costill 1984; Costill and Hargreaves 1992) If muscle glycogen is low athletes will not be able to maintain exercise intensity muscles will fatigue and lose strength along with the ability to protect joints coordination will suffer protective motor programmes will be replaced by less efficient and more risky movement patterns awareness of the game and environment will decrease and reactions will slow (Schlabach 1994) These are the circumstances when injury is most likely to occur

Therefore the primary nutrient that is required to avoid fatigue is carbohydrate Athletes who are maintaining high-volume high-intensity exercise are most at risk and must optimise carbohydrate intake Athletes should aim to consume 5–13g/kgbw per day (depending on volume and intensity of exercise) by eating pre during and post exercise (Jeukendrup and Gleeson 2004)

# Long-term Fatigue

Athletes that are in heavy training for prolonged periods are at risk of progressively depleting glycogen stores leading to drop off in performance increased risk of injury compromised immune system and increased risk of illness and ultimately overtraining syndrome (Kirwan et al 1988)

# Fluid

Fluid intake is the other primary factor in reducing signs of fatigue The effects of dehydration
---
# Nutrition During Injury

# NUTRITION DURING INJURY

# Dehydration and Injury Risk

Dehydration can largely mimic the effects of fatigue and contribute to injury risk There is also greater risk of heat injury when dehydrated as the is unable to thermo-regulate effectively Glycogen use increases when dehydrated further compounding the problems

Athletes should be aware of and look out for the effects of dehydration Initially these may include thirst dark urine tiredness lack of concentration dry skin and headache Fluid intake should be monitored and matched to sweat losses Fluid replacement strategies should be in place before during and after the game or training (Rehrer et al 1990; Shirreffs et al 1996; Casa et al 2000; Sharp 2006)

# Other Factors to Consider in Injury Prevention

# Iron

Low iron intakes have the potential to affect injury risk through fatigue In study on female cross-country runners over the course of the season there were 71 injuries that caused loss of training time The 34 runners with the lowest ferritin concentrations had twice as many injuries as the 34 runners with the highest ferritin (Loosli et al 1993) As iron plays crucial role in the transport of oxygen to muscles it is likely that athletes with low haemoglobin (caused by iron deficiency) have decreased oxygen delivery to tissues reducing work capacity (Viteri and Torun 1974) and therefore fatigue more easily

# Bone Health

Nutrition can affect bone health in several ways First low fat and low energy intakes are associated with an increased risk of stress fractures particularly in physically active women (Frusztajer et al 1990; Nattiv 2000) Supplementation with calcium (2000mg) and Vitamin D (800IU) however has been shown to decrease the incidence of stress fractures in female navy recruits by 20% compared with placebo (Lappe et al 2008)

In the longer term diet that is deficient in energy fat calcium or vitamin D may lead to osteoporosis Moreover other nutrients such as magnesium and potassium along with an adequate protein intake also appear to play significant role in preventing the loss of bone mineral density (Hannan et al 2000; Tucker et al 2001)

Athletes and in particular female athletes should therefore ensure they consume balanced diet containing sufficient energy protein fat calcium and vitamin D with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables to ensure balanced micronutrient intake (Tucker et al 2001)

# Nutrition During Injury

Injury can lead to range of complex nutritional issues for some athletes Body mass management (preventing weight gain during injury restoration of muscle mass post-injury) is crucial for effective rehabilitation For example if the athlete has significant reduction in activity levels as result of injury then the diet will need to change to reflect the drop in energy expenditure Moreover athletes with poor diets who have previously avoided weight gain through training or those who turn to food for comfort are likely to put on weight when injured making it harder for them to return to full fitness If however the athlete can maintain energy expenditure through other forms of exercise then diet may not need to change

Education is priority Athletes must aim for nutrient-rich and healthy diet that is sufficient to maintain energy balance Athletes should focus on low-fat low-sugar high-fiber foods that provide sufficient carbohydrate protein and fat and which provide optimal vitamin and mineral intakes

Despite lower activity levels when injured athletes who are hospitalized or subject to long-term incapacity may still require increased protein (approx 14–17g/kg/day) to prevent loss of lean tissue and maintain immune function (Bucci 1994) This can be met through the selection of low-fat protein options such as lean meat fish and skimmed milk

# Supplements

The use of supplements by athletes requires caution Whilst there is substantial of evidence that some substances found in the diet have an ergogenic or anabolic effect under certain conditions – for example caffeine for endurance and power performance and creatine for increasing short-term high-intensity exercise and muscle mass (Birch et al 1994; Williams and Branch 1998; Greenhaff 2000; Graham 2001; Maughan et al 2004; Doherty and Smith 2005; Hespel et al 2006) – many of

# Nutritional Considerations for Performance and Rehabilitation

The elaborate claims made for supplements by manufacturers do not stand up to scientific scrutiny Moreover many supplements contain substances not declared on the and in some cases these substances contravene IOC or WADA doping regulations and would cause an athlete to fail drugs test (Geyer et al 2004; Maughan 2005) For example in an IOC funded study of 634 products labelled as non-hormonal nutritional supplements from 13 countries and 215 different suppliers 148% contained anabolic steroid precursors not declared on the (Schanzer 2002; Geyer et al 2004) For products purchased in the UK this rose to 188% (Schanzer 2002; Geyer et al 2004)

It appears that for those athletes who may be required to take drugs test supplements are another potential source of contamination It is therefore possible that an athlete could fail drugs test due to the unintentional ingestion of prohibited substances present in dietary supplements (Maughan 2005) It is simply impossible to know for sure that any given supplement is pure and not contaminated by some substance that may be prohibited

The principle of strict liability present in the World Anti-Doping Code means that athletes are ultimately responsible for any prohibited substances found in their system (UK Sport (2008) position statement on the use of supplements – July 2008) The unintentional ingestion of prohibited substances is not considered an acceptable excuse and athletes should therefore exhibit extreme caution when deciding on the use of dietary supplements Moreover supplements should not be considered solution to poor diet and athletes should strive to optimise their nutritional intake before considering the need for supplements

# Position Statement of UK Sport Version 5 issued in July 2008

There is an array of supplements available for athletes to purchase through range of retail sources that have no prohibited substances listed as ingredients Despite this there have been several cases whereby supplement products have been contaminated with prohibited substances as defined by the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) Prohibited List

UK athletes are advised to be vigilant in their choice to use any supplement No guarantee can be given that any particular supplement is free from Prohibited Substances

Athletes should be aware that any product that claims to restore correct or modify the ’s physiological functions should be licensed as medicine according to current legislation (for further information visit the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency website at wwwmhragovuk)

Diet lifestyle and training should all be optimised before considering supplements and athletes should assess the need for supplements by always consulting an accredited sports dietician and/or registered nutritionist with expertise in sports nutrition and sports and exercise medicine doctor before taking supplements

An important principle of the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) is that of strict liability stating athletes are ultimately responsible for any Prohibited Substances found in their system or for the use of any Prohibited Method Therefore before taking supplements athletes must assess the risk and understand their personal responsibility

In an attempt to support athletes number of initiatives have been created globally to identify whether prohibited substance can be identified within supplement As such supplements may claim to be drug free or safe for drug tested athletes It is not possible to guarantee that specific supplements will be free of prohibited substances but only to reduce the risk of inadvertent doping by making informed decisions

In the UK HFL Sports Science has taken the initiative to create scheme to support athletes in assessing the risk The Informed-Sport programme is designed to evaluate supplement manufacturers for their process integrity and screening of supplements and ingredients for the presence of prohibited substances that are present on the WADC Prohibited List The supplements industry has been consulted on this approach and supports its development

# Chapter Overview

The aim of this chapter is to illustrate the importance of psychology for professional working in sports rehabilitation and to provide practical ways of applying psychology in practice Psychology has been used with injured athletes in two main ways: firstly in identifying those at risk of injury and secondly in enhancing recovery Additionally helping injured athletes to develop psychological skills such as goal setting or imagery ensures that they are not only ‘physically fit’ following sports rehabilitation but also ‘mentally fit’ for their subsequent return to sport (Murphy 2005)

# Structure of the Chapter

The chapter is divided into two sections:

1 # Theory and Issues

This begins with brief examination of why psychology is important to sports rehabilitators It discusses the importance of the stress model as basis for identifying players who may be at higher risk of injury (Williams and Andersen 1998) It also covers emotional responses such as the grief-loss model (Kübler-Ross 1969) and its relevance to injured athletes The continues with discussion on adherence mental toughness as facilitator of adherence and concludes with the SCRAPE model (Hinderliter and Cardinal 2007) as way of organizing the variables of injury recovery
2 # Psychological Skills Training

The latter half of the chapter discusses psychological skills training in relation to injury prevention and management

# Why Psychology for Sports Rehabilitators?

Your role as sports rehabilitator is to prepare the athlete for return to sport or performance as physically fit However the rehabilitative process can be painful time-consuming and uncomfortable Your patient/client may require techniques for managing pain and relieving stress Therefore it is essential to address the psychological and emotional issues of your injured athlete If your athlete is to heal psychologically as well as physically you need to understand how issues such as stress and adherence affect the rehabilitation process You may also want to help athletes use psychological skills techniques such as goal setting and self-talk

# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

The application of psychology to sports rehabilitation is often neglected in the training of sports rehabilitators and other practitioners (Mann et al 2007) Practitioners often report that they wish they had more training in psychology (Francis Andersen and Maley 2000; Ninedek and Kolt 2000; Sheppard 2004) as better integration of psychology within rehabilitation programme will increase sports rehabilitator’s understanding of the psychology of injury (Hemming and Povey 2002) Arvinen-Barrow Hemmings Weigand and Becker (2007) pointed out that physiotherapists perceived that athletes suffered psychologically for approximately 83% of the time they were injured According to Arvinen-Barrow and her colleagues (2007) sports injury professionals utilized some psychological techniques but felt that additional psychological training would be beneficial

In recent study Hamson-Utley Martin and Walters (2008) found that those working in sports rehabilitation do have positive attitudes on the effectiveness of psychological skills in enhancing recovery With this positive mindset you should find that this chapter will help you as sports rehabilitator to integrate psychological theory and practical suggestions within sport rehabilitation It aims to assist you in becoming more skilled practitioner so that you can help your athletes in more comprehensive way To begin the stress–injury relationship will be examined as this is the foundation in understanding why certain athletes may be more prone to injury

# Emotional Responses to Sports Injury and Rehabilitation

Understanding athletes’ emotional response to injury has led to variety of research which falls into two general categories: cognitive appraisal and the stage model Cognitive appraisal will be explained through Williams and Andersen’s (1998) stress–injury relationship The stage approach will be examined through Kübler-Ross (1969) research on grief and loss

# Cognitive Appraisal: The Stress–Injury Relationship Model

There is continued debate regarding stress and destressing Of course stress can affect performance but more importantly to you as sports rehabilitator stress raises the injury incidence level making your athlete more prone to injury Williams and Andersen (2007) showed that approximately 85% of studies conducted since the 1970s have demonstrated positive correlation between life-event stress and injury In fact stressed athletes run 2–5 times greater risk of injury than athletes with low life-event stress This is quite an extraordinary finding and is consistent across numerous sports (Williams and Andersen 2007) Stress as result of injury is also commonly identified by practitioners as being present during the rehabilitation process Heaney (2006) noted that stress and anxiety were present in professional footballers 73% of the time that they were injured For those working with youth teams and academies stress is also present in children (Nippert and Smith 2008)

# Components of the Model

Let us examine each of the components of the sport stress–injury relationship illustrated above by Williams and Andersen (1998) so you can see how an understanding of each of the parts as well as the integration of the model can be useful to you as sports rehabilitator

# Personality

Personality is defined as “ dynamic organization inside the person of psychophysical systems that create person’s characteristic patterns of behaviour thoughts and feelings” (Carver and Scheier 2000 p5) The definition above implies that personality is dynamic We are born with some aspects of personality (traits) and this innate genetic predisposition may be difficult to change or may be unchangeable For example some athletes are naturally more anxious and this is known as trait anxiety Your athletes therefore may have certain traits that are integral to their personality and hard to alter However other aspects of personality are more environmental oriented and may be changeable These are referred to as state or situational characteristics That is your athlete may react to certain events in particular way whether or not they possess particular trait For instance they may become more nervous in competitive situation or in your clinic or before returning back to game following an injury (eg state anxiety) even if they are not trait anxious

# Cognitive Appraisal: The Stress–Injury Relationship Model

# Understanding Stress and Injury

Athletes can be helped through altering perceptions or implementing coping skills It is important to distinguish between trait and state as some athletes may appear to have problems only at certain times which can be confusing for rehabilitators Knowing if an issue is usual trait (eg an athlete is usually anxious) or state (eg specific competitive event or part of the event such as starting on the blocks) is helpful in assisting the athlete to change

If it is usual trait daily coping strategies can be encouraged to deal with something that is part of their usual personality If it is state identifying the trigger and promoting strategies to assist the athlete in coping with specific situation is beneficial

A specific personality variable related to stress is self-esteem or how one values oneself Research indicates that those with lower self-esteem are more likely to feel stressed (Kolt and Roberts 1998) During the sporting season athletes with low self-esteem and low mood states (eg anxiety and depression) were more susceptible to stress (Williams et al 1993) making them more prone to injury as illustrated by Williams and Andersen (1998) Therefore as sports rehabilitator it is crucial to understand your athlete’s personality as even the most confident player may experience anxiety or low confidence when injured

# History of Stressors

The history of stressors refers to how an athlete feels about previous events and/or experiences These can be real threats such as recovery from major injury or perceived threats such as the worry of recovering from an injury after returning to complete physical fitness Additionally history of stressors can refer to prior major life events or the impact of minor occurrences

Research has shown that experiences can impact the risk of an athlete getting injured again (Maddison and Prapavessis 2005; Steffen et al 2008) For instance an athlete with previous injuries may worry about returning to competitive sport concerned about the severity of past injuries and the potential risk of re-injury which can lead to elevated stress levels A study by Chase Magyar and Drake (2005) found that gymnasts were particularly fearful of injuries especially regarding the difficulty of returning to competition after an injury Thus these athletes often worry about what 'could happen' Working on self-confidence can be beneficial in supporting athletes dealing with history of injuries

Major life-changing events or minor hassles can also impact the athlete Major life events can be sport-related such as returning to sport with disability or more generic such as relationship breakdown or the death of loved one This was confirmed by Williams and Andersen (2007) in their review of over 40 studies While it is evident that major life events can increase stress levels smaller hassles or stressors can have similar effect For example study by Fawkner McMurray and Summer (1999) found that significant increases in minor events can elevate stress Situations like arriving at competition where events are delayed due to rain or arriving late because of minibus breakdown can contribute to stress It is not only the stress that creates problem but also how anything on the athlete's mind whether small or large can distract from the sporting task at hand Disruption to concentration or attentional disruption can increase the risk of injury

Hanson et al (1992) identified coping resources as the best determinants for predicting both the severity and number of injuries in an athlete Therefore better understanding of coping strategies can significantly impact your practice as sports rehabilitator A more detailed introduction to coping skills is provided in two (psychological skills)

Referring back to the stress model coping strategies feed into the stress response and interact with personality Coping strategies are methods of dealing with problems or situations Folkman and Lazarus (1984 141) define coping as “constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands”

# Understanding Coping Strategies

It has been found that variety of coping strategies are utilized in sport (Nicholls et al 2007) such as venting crying or even the use of alcohol and drugs (Kowalski and Crocker 2001) There are two types or categories of coping strategies predominantly used: problem-focused and emotion-focused coping (Lazarus and Folkman 1984)

Emotion-focused coping involves dealing with and managing emotions while problem-focused coping focuses on managing the problem itself Within these categories there are various coping strategies (Wethington and Kessler 1991) including:

- Avoidance coping: dealing with the problem by running away or using substances like alcohol or drugs (Carver et al 1989)
- Seeking social support: turning to religion or enlisting help from others

# Effectiveness of Coping Strategies

Research consistently supports the use of various coping strategies for meeting the demands of injury and life emphasizing the necessity for adapting these strategies to meet individual needs For example:

- Carson and Polman (2008) cited the benefits of using problem-focused coping in case study with rugby player undergoing ACL rehabilitation
- Gallagher and Gardner (2007) advised that avoidance as coping technique was detrimental to athletes and associated with higher levels of negative moods
- Social support is beneficial; athletes with high levels of social support had fewer injuries regardless of life-event stress (Hardy et al 1991; Smith et al 1990a)

Therefore it is recommended that injured athletes seek support from friends (inside and outside sport) and family when they are injured – or ideally before

# Conclusion

There is strong link between inadequate coping skills and sports injury (Williams et al 1986) It is important for sports rehabilitators to understand coping strategies and encourage effective ones

# Cognitive Appraisal

The next component within the stress–injury model is cognitive appraisal (how an athlete perceives stress) and physiological/attentional changes Cognitive appraisal affects stress levels which can lead to an increased risk of injury

The term cognition pertains to thought patterns and processes Cognitive appraisal is what your athlete thinks about situation affecting their emotional and behavioral responses Seeing situation (or injury during the recovery process) as challenge (facilitative) rather than threat (debilitative) will positively affect behavior

# Emotional Responses to Sports Injury and Rehabilitation: A Stage Model

Understanding how athletes feel and behave during competition or the rehabilitative process is crucial Cognitive appraisal is dynamic process that can change over time and it is up to you as rehabilitator to help your athlete see the positive challenge of the rehabilitative process

# Interventions

Johnson Ekengren and Andersen (2005) in study based on the Williams and Andersen (1998) stress–injury model designed program for soccer players identified as being at risk of injury An at-risk psychosocial profile was created for each athlete using:

- The Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith et al 1990b)
- The Life Event Scale for Collegiate Athletes (Petrie 1992)
- The Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 (Smith et al 1995)

They implemented an intervention scheme that taught athletes skills such as stress management and confidence building Their study showed that these athletes were injured far less than athletes in control group Similarly Maddison and Prapavessis (2005) conducted study with rugby players and found that athletes in the intervention group (who were taught to manage stress) had fewer injuries than those in the control group Such studies powerfully demonstrate how psychological interventions can impact the injury process which is often thought of as purely physical!

# Conclusion of the Stress Model

All components of the stress model have been described and it should now be clear how an integration of these various components works An athlete’s personality previous experiences and ways of dealing with excessive demands feed into their response to stress Their stress response is affected by their thoughts focus and bodily reactions Intervention strategies such as goal setting self-talk coping strategies and imagery can help reduce levels of stress caused by the stress response and reduction in stress levels can decrease the incidence of injury

To strengthen your knowledge on the model and coping strategies refer to: Williams and Andersen (1998) and Lazarus and Folkman (1984)

# Emotional Responses to Sports Injury and Rehabilitation: A Stage Model

Being injured is obviously an emotional experience for your athlete (Heil 1993) Tracey (2003) examined the emotional responses experienced by athletes as result of injury and during rehabilitation revealing that athletes demonstrate collection of emotions such as sense of loss decreased self-esteem frustration and anger

In examining athletic injury classic ‘stage’ model by Kübler-Ross (1969) has been applied to sport outlining normal progression of emotions Originally this model was designed as framework for understanding the psychological response during the grieving process However it was adapted to parallel the stages of emotional response experienced by injured athletes (Crossman 1991)

# The Stages

# Denial

There are two aspects of denial Firstly the shock state immediately following the injury when the player is in state of disbelief and may even respond

# Anger

Anger can be directed at the injury oneself or even the medical staff

# Negotiation

In this stage athletes negotiate deal for example ‘I will do all my exercises and be better person if I can fully recover and return to competition’

# Depression

This stage involves feelings of sadness and despair regarding the injury

# Acceptance

The final stage where athletes come to terms with their injury and begin to move forward

stage 

# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

# Emotional Responses to Injury

# Shortness of Breath and Physical Freezing

Initially athletes may experience shortness of breath and physical freezing This can progress into denial period where the athlete struggles to accept their limitations due to injury It is important to guide them through the reality of the situation though acceptance may take time

# Anger

Anger is common response where athletes may blame others for their situation expressing thoughts like “The opponent should not have tripped me up” They may also direct anger towards the rehabilitator believing that previous injuries were not managed properly The best approach is to remain calm allowing the athlete to express their feelings Acknowledge their anger as normal response and encourage them to reflect on past experiences of anger due to injury and how they overcame it

# Bargaining

This stage involves negotiation where the athlete may promise to attend all rehabilitation sessions in exchange for your commitment to help them recover This can sometimes include spiritual or religious promises for better health

# Depression

Depression manifests as hopelessness and despair with athletes expressing sentiments like “my sports career is over” They may show reluctance to attend rehabilitation sessions or engage in home exercises To combat this focus on positive outcomes asking questions like “What will you do when you complete your rehabilitation?” or “How will you celebrate your return to sport?” Encourage them to visualize past successes in their sport

# Acceptance

Encouragement is key in this stage where acceptance involves acknowledging the injury and committing to the rehabilitation process Athletes may express this by stating “I am going to the gym regularly and working on these exercises at home”

# Conclusions on the Stage Model of Grief-Loss

The Kübler-Ross (1969) stage model has faced criticism for suggesting sequential order of emotional experiences Psychologists now view these stages as fluid phases with not all athletes experiencing them in the same order or at all As professional it is crucial to be aware of the emotional states your client may be navigating

Carson and Polman (2008) identified stages of shock depression relief encouragement and confidence development in anterior cruciate ligament patients For further understanding of the Kübler-Ross grief-loss model refer to the “Psychological responses to injury in competitive sport: critical review” by Walker Thatcher and Lavallee (2007) which examines the impact of psychological factors on injury experiences and integrates emotional behavioral and cognitive responses to injury and recovery

# Behavioral Responses to Sports Injury and Rehabilitation

# Adherence

Adherence refers to the commitment of the athlete to stick to recovery program which may include attending rehabilitation sessions following special diet completing home exercises participating in adapted training programs and developing mental strategies Creating an individualized rehabilitative program that incorporates psychological aspects is essential for promoting adherence

Techniques will benefit your patient in facilitating recovery in the most efficient way possible

Adherence differs from compliance which assumes that the patient will obediently follow your instruction without question Adherence is voluntary negotiated agreement between the patient and you Patient involvement is important and is positively related with adherence (Lind et al 2008)

However not all athletes will follow your rehabilitation programme as agreed and adherence can range from under-adherence to over-adherence Under-adherence is doing less than what is prescribed The cost of under-adherence to the patient may be slower recovery as well as lower confidence about their progress Sometimes additional factors can interfere with progress and be the cause of under-adherence For example athletes may receive more attention from their coaches and team members when they are injured than when they are fit They may also want to avoid the pain associated with having to follow regime of rehabilitative exercises Remember that patients can forget to stick to their programmes once or twice but forgetting three times is probably no longer an accident Athletes need to display the same commitment to their rehabilitation as they do to their training though it is important as sports rehabilitator to remember that today’s patients have to balance other commitments as well such as study friends and family

Over-adherence on the other hand is doing more than one should during recovery Some athletes will over-adhere to rehabilitation programme in the hope of recovering quicker This may be due to not wanting to lose their place in an upcoming competition or position on team perfectionist tendencies or perhaps pressure from other people such as their coach or teammates

One way of helping athletes to adhere to their recovery programme is to get them to use diary An interesting study by Pizzari Taylor McBurney and Feller (2005) examined the relationship between adherence and outcome following ACL surgery Adherence was measured by self-reported diary of home exercise and from attendance to appointments In clinical practice the use of diary to track daily and weekly progress is an easy way of both empowering the athlete to track their own progress and perhaps for you to examine adherence – if they let you see their diary that is! Of course willingness to keep diary in the first place is one indicator that an athlete is keen to be proactive in the rehabilitation process The results indicated that there was relationship between adherence to home exercises and outcome measured by knee function Home exercise adherence is an important predictor of the rehabilitation adherence and was also demonstrated in study of patients with wrist fractures (Lyngcoln et al 2005) The use of self-reported diary to track home exercise appears to be useful way of monitoring adherence; you may wish to consider this when working with clients

# Factors that Influence Adherence

Through interviews with sports physiotherapists Niven (2007) identified number of factors that influence adherence in sports rehabilitation programmes In particular an athlete’s personality as well as situational factors impact adherence to rehabilitation programmes Personality may impact on adherence as athletes who are high in anxiety show reduced adherence to their rehabilitative programmes (Taylor and Taylor 1997) In addition how your athlete perceives the efficacy of your treatment protocol and the confidence they have in rehabilitation will affect their adherence to your sports injury programme (Brewer et al 2003; Taylor and May 1996)

To help your athlete to have confidence in you effective communication and solid working relationship are essential In fact when physiotherapists and athletes have these factors in place more effective recovery programme and more positive outcomes result (Crossman 1997; Francis et al 2000; Ninedek and Kolt 2000)

# Determinants of Adherence

One way of altering adherence is to identify the factors that determine their adherence to programme Crossman (2001) divided the factors into three classifications: predisposing reinforcing and enabling factors

# Predisposing Factors

These are the athlete’s own views and thoughts about the recovery process In order to get an idea from your patient about their perceptions towards rehabilitation you may want to ask about their normal habits and preferences
---
# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

# Reinforcing Factors

Reinforcing factors are based on the interactions between the athlete and other significant individuals such as the sports rehabilitator coach team or other important persons For instance you could ask:

- Are you in touch with the coach and your team?
- Do you feel that there is good reason to go through the recovery process?
- Has the rehabilitative process been explained to you?

# Enabling Factors

These factors relate to the environment surrounding the rehabilitation treatment Identifying which of these factors is preventing an athlete from attending sessions can help you as sports rehabilitator to improve your client’s adherence For instance you might ask about:

- Is it easy or hard for you to get to your appointments? What can be done to make attending easier?
- How do you get to these sessions?
- How long does it take you to get home afterwards?
- Are there things (eg homework other appointments family duties) that make it hard for you to complete your home exercises?

As rehabilitator it is helpful to identify the predisposing reinforcing and enabling factors behind adherence in your athlete so that you can work on modifying any unhealthy behaviors or thoughts thus strengthening the rehabilitative process For further reading please see: Crossman (1997) Francis et al (2000) and Ninedek and Kolt (2000)

# Mental Toughness and Rehabilitation

Mental toughness is having psychological advantage in coping with the stressful demands (Fletcher and Fletcher 2005) associated with competition as well as in rehabilitation and return to sport after injury (Jones et al 2002) Although mental toughness is relatively new area of research studies are demonstrating that these factors are important as part of an athlete’s mindset Levy Polman Clough Marchant and Earle (2006) found that patients with high mental toughness were more capable of managing pain and displaying more positive outlook

Mental toughness is defined by Middleton Marsh Martin Richards and Perry (1997) as “an unshakeable perseverance and conviction towards some goal despite pressure or adversity” Jones Hanton and Connaughton (2002) state that it is “the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to generally cope better than your opponents with the many demands that sport places on performer” So mental toughness is about being able to cope under pressure and not giving into it

So does mental toughness help in rehabilitative setting? Mentally tough individuals have been shown to demonstrate greater ability to withstand physical pain (Jones et al 2002) and to recover more quickly from injury (Gucciardi et al 2008) In addition mentally tough participants perceive their injury to be less severe feel that they are less susceptible to further injury and focus less on their pain during the course of their rehabilitation (Levy et al 2006) Perhaps surprisingly even greater attendance at rehabilitation sessions is demonstrated by those with greater mental toughness (Levy et al 2005; Marchant and Earle 2006) If you want to explore this area further begin by reading the following: Gucciardi et al (2008) Jones et al (2002) and Levy et al (2006)

# Implications of Emotional and Behavioural Responses

In summarising one of this chapter you can see how there are several implications for you as sports rehabilitator in understanding and incorporating psychological theory into your practice To start with you need to be aware of the relationship between stress and injury because you are in key position to identify and help athletes who are at greater risk of injury

As sports rehabilitator it is useful to understand how personality affects the stress process and how an athlete’s past can affect how they deal with stressful situation You are in good position to encourage athletes to improve their coping strategies in handling stressful major life events as well as in handling daily hassles (Johnson et al 2005)

By catering to the emotional and behavioural needs of your athlete you are more likely to offer comprehensive treatment that will enable your athlete to be stronger both psychologically and physiologically Recovery can also be optimised through adherence and mental toughness

Finally (Tracey 2003) points out that the experience of injury can give an athlete an increased understanding that recovery is process in which an athlete can reflect and grow emotionally You as rehabilitator are often in unique position to become involved in developing intervention programmes for athletes

There have been variety of psychological interventions identified which facilitate adjustment to injury such as goal setting imagery and stress management (Evans et al 2000; Johnson 2000; Johnson et al 2005) Interventions in terms of psychological skills training and how they can be used will now be explained

# Psychological Skills Training in the Injury Process

The injury process may be simplistically divided into the time before an injury (pre-injury period) and the time following injury lasting until the performer is fully rehabilitated and ready to return to activity (rehabilitation period) The role of psychological skills training (PST) in each stage will be outlined in this 

It is important to recognise that while the physical therapist or sports rehabilitator is not sport psychologist they are still in good place to encourage injured athletes to practice mentally and to give them some basic tips about how to do so (Gordon et al 1998)

This part of the chapter informs you about what psychological skills are and how they may help prevent injury as well as support injury rehabilitation You will notice that imagery is mentioned more frequently than other psychological skills; this is only because there is more research into its role and effectiveness But one study found that of number of psychological skills people actually rate goal setting as their favourite (Brewer et al 1994)

This means that it might be easier to “sell” goal setting to the people you meet; perhaps because it feels like very practical and not overly ‘psychological’ technique Still the best approach is probably to recommend variety of psychological skills to injured performers so that they can choose what suits them best

If you are interested in exploring this topic further chapter by (Kolt 2000) gives very interesting example of how physical and psychological treatment following ACL reconstruction can go hand in hand For additional material see the books on the psychological aspects of injury by (Pargman 2007; Taylor and Taylor 1997; Heil 1993)

# Psychological Skills and Psychological Skills Training

Psychological skills (sometimes called mental skills) include goal setting imagery self-talk and various forms of relaxation and PST (or mental skills training MST) is simply the systematic training of such skills

For example hockey coach who does bit of informal goal setting with his team in order to prepare for the upcoming season would be said to use the psychological skill of goal setting If instead he designs and implements programme of goal setting over number of weeks perhaps teaching his athletes about how to make goal setting effective and evaluating it at the end he could be said to be implementing PST programme

As you might imagine the effects of the various psychological skills are greater when implemented systematically; therefore it is good idea to learn more about and regularly practice these skills You might also be wondering which psychological skill is ‘best’ or whether you have to study and practise (or recommend) them all But while that might seem simple and

# Psychological Skills Training (PST)

There is no known ‘optimal recipe’ for how to use PST Some researchers examine only one skill while others examine several Due to the vast number of sports age groups study purposes and potential combinations of psychological skills available it is challenging to determine which psychological skills to practice Sport psychologists often recommend various skills or combinations of skills to performers allowing them to choose what works best for their specific circumstances thereby optimizing the chances of success

# Goal Setting

Goal setting is process of planning ahead for what one wants and how to achieve it There is wide variety of potential goals for both healthy sports participation and rehabilitation For example one athlete's rehabilitation goal might be to be back on by the last game of the season while another might focus on process-oriented approach such as performing rehabilitation exercises three times daily

A common acronym for effective goal setting is SMART which indicates that goals should be Specific Measurable Accurate Realistic and Timed (Cox 2001; Weinberg and Gould 2007) It is crucial that most goals focus on individual performance (eg regaining complete strength of an injured leg) and the processes contributing to this (eg doing three sets of eight reps of rehabilitation exercises daily for three weeks) Process and performance goals are superior to mainly outcome goals (eg returning faster from injury than another injured player) because outcome goals depend on factors outside one's control and may lead to lowered self-confidence and heightened anxiety

Individually appropriate and relevant goals set jointly between the performer their rehabilitator and where appropriate coach promote sense of control (Taylor and Taylor 1997) In rehabilitation goal setting is favored method for athletes to ‘get back on track’ (Brewer et al 1994; Durso Cupal 1998)

# Imagery

Imagery is the creation or re-creation of experiences in one's mind (White and Hardy 1998) It may involve one or more senses such as visualizing oneself performing particular exercise or feeling muscles move Most imagery work in sport focuses on concrete imagery related to oneself (eg gymnast imagining herself completing floor routine) but more abstract metaphorical images have also been reported especially in healing imagery (Korn 1983; Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Green 1992; Evans et al 2006) and artistic activities like dance (Hanrahan and Vergeer 2000; Nordin and Cumming 2005)

In metaphorical imagery performer might visualize the hip joint moving as wheel or imagine toxins as black substance gradually rinsed out or diluted with breath These actions may not be strictly accurate but can support person’s understanding of movement induce relaxation or serve similar purposes The types of imagery that performers may use during rehabilitation include all those experienced in their everyday lives such as visualizing and feeling how they perform certain skills to retain them while recovering from an injury

Performers have also been found to engage in healing-type images when injured (Driediger et al 2006; Evans et al 2006; Green 1992; Hanrahan and Vergeer 2000; Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Korn 1983; Milne et al 2005; Nordin and Cumming 2005; Sordoni et al 2000 2002; Short et al 2004) Healing imagery might include metaphorical images as described above as well as more concrete images of physiological processes related to healing such as tissue repairing itself back to normal

While healing imagery appears to yield positive results it is essential to recognize that individuals may have strong preferences regarding imagery types For instance some people respond well to images of white blood cells attacking local irritants and cleansing white air entering the lungs and circulation while others may find such abstract imagery far-fetched Some performers prefer detailed imagery of anatomical structures and their functions while others may find this too complex Therefore creativity in the use of imagery is encouraged

# Imagery

The encouragement of imagery involves regularly checking that you and the client are ‘on the same page’ Offering menu of images ranging from strictly anatomical to very abstract might be good idea as is having examples and anecdotes of how such images have been helpful to other clients at the ready

For those who work with injured performers (eg physiotherapists sports physicians sports rehabilitators) to encourage their clients to use imagery effectively they must clearly first learn about how imagery can be used to assist injured athletes (Driediger et al 2006) In addition having tried it out yourself first is essential One useful approach is for the rehabilitator to link imagery in relation to injury with the imagery that an athlete likely already does as part of their training For example you could ask them to describe how they rehearse sport skills strategies and scenarios in their mind around competition and then say that imagery in the rehabilitation process is really similar This should help reassure the athlete that they already have the requisite skills to do rehabilitation imagery If you inform them that healing imagery has been shown to be effective in well-controlled research studies it might also help dispel some of the uncertainty or apprehension about of imagery that is perhaps less intuitive than simple mental rehearsal (Morris et al 2005; Wiese et al 1991)

# Self-Talk

The cognitive process of talking to oneself is simply referred to as self-talk Like imagery it is basic of thought and most of us do it all the time – although more or less consciously Self-talk may be positive negative or neutral in nature (Hardy et al 2001 2005) and although some athletes report that negative self-talk is motivating for them (Van Raalte et al 1995; Hardy et al 2001) mostly the research findings are as you might guess; that is more positive results come from positive self-talk and more negative results come from negative self-talk (see Hardy (2006) for more in-depth discussion)

Positive self-talk includes generally motivating statements like “I know I can do this!” whilst negative self-talk might include statements such as “she gave me just too many rehabilitation exercises – I will never be able to do them all every day” Neutral self-talk may be instructional in nature including statements such as “arm in line with shoulders relaxed” perhaps designed to help remember and execute shoulder rehabilitation exercise correctly

# Relaxation

Whilst number of PST ‘packages’ include relaxation it is rarely investigated on its own in sport psychology; thus the number of studies examining the effects of relaxation for injured performers are few and far between Even so relaxation is widely used technique that appeals to many performers as most people intuitively appreciate the feeling of being calm and relaxed A number of ways of achieving relaxation response exist and we will not describe them all here; instead we will limit ourselves to brief outline of some methods that are typically employed in PST programmes Note also that while the sport psychology literature typically refers to relaxation ‘techniques’ or ‘procedures’ many people have developed their own ways of relaxing; for instance just by breathing deeply by listening to music or by doing yoga or another of calming exercise

One of the best known of the established techniques is progressive relaxation first proposed by Jacobson in 1929 In this technique the performer first contracts particular muscle group and thereafter relaxes it This way it is proposed that the athlete will learn to distinguish between the feelings of tension and relaxation It is notable that imagery seems to play part in progressive relaxation; that is typical progressive relaxation script would guide the participant’s attention toward the feeling of their muscles relaxing in suggestive fashion For example script used by Gill Kolt and Keating (2004 p292) tells participants to “Relax your feet and lower legs Be aware of the tension being released Release all the tension As the tension fades away focus on the new relaxed feeling in your feet and lower legs Continue to focus on this feeling”

Another of relaxation is autogenic training created by psychiatrist Johannes Schultz in 1932 It is somewhat similar to progressive relaxation with both techniques going through various parts of the and involving imagery as well as suggestive statements concerning the being relaxed Different from progressive relaxation however autogenic training focuses on limbs being warm and heavy and typically also focuses more on the regulation of heart rate breathing and temperature (Cox 2002; Noh and Morris 2004)

# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

# Combined PST

As noted above many studies as well as real-life interventions use psychological skills in combination The following examples give you some idea of how that might be done:

- Use self-talk to guide yourself through an imagery sequence
- Imagine yourself achieving goal
- Set goal to do imagery for 10 minutes daily in order to enhance performance
- Use self-talk to remind yourself of your goals
- If you have learned relaxation procedure simply thinking through that procedure would be of self-talk as you would be telling yourself what to do!

# Coping Skills

Some researchers into PST and injury have looked at the concept of coping skills Indeed coping resources are key component of the Williams and Andersen (1998) model of stress and athletic injury described above Somewhat similar to psychological skills coping skills typically include goal setting and/or another of mental preparation but also deal with constructs such as:

- Coping with adversity
- Peaking under pressure
- Concentration
- Freedom from worry
- Confidence
- Achievement motivation
- Coachability

In other words having good coping skills means that an athlete would handle variety of situations in confident capable way and be resilient to setbacks Note that while these coping skills should help performer cope with varying circumstances the psychological skills literature would typically argue that characteristics such as concentration self-confidence and freedom from worry and excessive anxiety may be achieved through PST For example goal setting might be used to improve footballer’s anxiety levels or imagery might be employed for runner who would like to improve her self-confidence So what does all this mean for you in practice? Well simply that it is important to be clear about what it is you want to achieve (eg being able to cope with adversity such as returning from debilitating long-term injury) and the techniques that might be available to help you do so (eg the psychological skills of goal setting imagery self-talk and relaxation)

# Psychological Skills Training in the Pre-Injury Period

One of the most fascinating findings that have emerged in recent years is that psychological skills training can help performers avoid injury The findings related to injury prevention fall into two categories: reduced injury frequency and reduced injury duration

# Reduced Injury Frequency

The existing research indicates that multitude of positive benefits stand to be obtained from PST including preventing injuries from happening in the first place (Davis 1991; Johnson et al 2005; Kerr and Goss 1996; Kolt et al 2004; May and Brown 1989; Perna et al 2003; Schomer 1990) In one study relaxation and imagery intervention reduced injury by as much as 52% (Davis 1991) Intervention studies have used various combinations of psychological skills and stress inoculation training (essentially training performers to handle stress better over time) to reduce injury frequency And although this means that we do not have very clear idea of which psychological skill does what it also suggests that the effect is fairly robust Moreover the activities used in the various studies have included:

- Soccer (Johnson et al 2005)
- Alpine skiing (May and Brown 1989)
- Swimming (Davis 1991)
- Gymnastics (Kerr and Goss 1996; Kolt et al 2004)
- Rowing (Perna et al 2003)
- Marathon running (Schomer 1990)

This diversity further suggests that the findings are not anomalous unique or sport-specific Instead the studies indicate that the effect is due to PST helping athletes lower their stress levels feel more confident and optimistic become more aware of their bodies and build their ability to cope with difficulties

# Reduced Injury Duration

In study by Noh Morris and Andersen (2005) it was shown that ballet dancers’ psychological skills and coping strategies distinguished between not just

# Psychological Skills Training in the Pre-Injury Period

# Psychological Skills Training in the Pre-Injury Period

Research indicates differences in injury frequencies and durations among dancers Specifically dancers with shorter injury durations reported less worry and negative stress alongside greater levels of confidence and achievement motivation These findings were utilized in an intervention study with ballet dancers (Noh et al 2007) where one group was taught imagery self-talk and autogenic training ( of relaxation) This group not only improved their coping skills but also spent less time injured compared to control group Similar results were observed in study involving rugby players (Maddison and Prapavessis 2005) where players identified with an "at-risk psychological profile for injury" participated in stress management program leading to better coping skills and reduced injury duration compared to control group

# Sample PST Programme to Prevent Injury

1 Set goals regularly Ensure they are SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-bound) and focus on personal progress rather than comparisons with others Seek regular feedback from knowledgeable individuals (eg coaches) and use this feedback along with personal judgment to keep goals flexible and evaluate progress A training diary can be useful tool for tracking goals and progress
2 Use imagery daily Experiment with various forms of imagery for different purposes such as improving performance boosting confidence reducing stress and focusing on goals Visualize performing technical skills rehearse strategies for overcoming challenges and imagine achieving your overall goals Make your imagery multisensory to enhance effectiveness—see feel hear and smell the environment related to your sport Regular deliberate imagery practice can yield significant benefits including injury prevention
3 Use self-talk to your advantage Ensure your inner dialogue supports both performance and well-being Prepare positive self-talk statements to counter negative thoughts when they arise Focus on these positive affirmations and repeat them as needed Over time you will become adept at identifying and dismissing negative self-talk Additionally use instructional self-talk to maintain focus on tasks especially during challenging moments (eg tired runner reminding herself of proper )
4 Relax -- you deserve it! Athletes often experience stress and tension in their daily lives Employ relaxation strategies to alleviate tension and provide relief for your muscles after intense activity Use relaxation techniques to enhance awareness—identify areas of tension and consider adjustments in your exercise or daily habits Relaxation may help prevent injury by reducing excess tension stress and anxiety while also improving awareness

# Psychological Skills Training in the Rehabilitation Period

# Benefits that may be obtained from PST in the rehabilitation period

Addressing the psychological side of injury once it has occurred has multitude of advantages (Heil 1993) For example rehabilitation may be accelerated with negative emotional experiences minimized and positive emotions maximized; it can activate coping strategies enhance readiness for return to activity and maintain confidence These positive outcomes will now be addressed

# Shorter Recovery Times

Studies have shown that athletes who recover more quickly from an injury use more psychological skills than those who recover more slowly (Ievleva and Orlick 1991) In this particular study goal setting positive self-talk and healing imagery were the skills that set the faster healers apart For example fast healers spoke to themselves in optimistic terms (eg “I can do anything”) while those who healed more slowly spoke to themselves more pessimistically (eg “What stupid thing to do”) Fast healers also reported experiencing fewer replay-images of their injury In other words it seems that imagery is capable of both slowing recovery down and speeding it up suggesting that performers should take care to engage only in facilitative constructive images It is possible that the shorter recovery times are result of better rehabilitation adherence and/or enhanced healing and physical functioning and these potential benefits are described next

# Greater Adherence with Rehabilitation Schedules

As mentioned above key concern for the rehabilitator is how to make performers stick with the recommendations and exercises given to them Fortunately low-to-no-cost PST can help you overcome this hurdle For instance it has been found that goal setting increases the extent to which athletes rehabilitating from ACL-reconstruction actually do the home exercises given to them (Scherzer et al 2001) These same authors also found goal setting to improve the work of these athletes while in the clinic; that is they worked with greater intensity and adhered to directions better Positive self-talk was also associated with adherence Although Scherzer et al (2001) did not find healing imagery to be related to adherence other studies have (Gould et al 1997; Jones and Stuth 1997) Still others have found that management of thoughts and emotions (as is done when using PST) sets those who rehabilitate successfully apart from those who do not (Udry et al 1997)

# Enhanced Healing and Physical Functioning

It is known that athletes can and do use psychological skills to support their physical healing processes (Calmels et al 2003; Driediger et al 2006; Evans et al 2000; Evans et al 2006; Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Milne et al 2004; Sordoni et al 2002) A handful of intervention studies have also examined whether teaching injured athletes psychological skills can improve aspects of their healing and/or physical functioning with promising results For instance relaxation practice and/or imagery can reduce pain sensations or help increase athletes’ pain tolerance (Broucek et al 1993; Cupal and Brewer 2001; Nicol 1993; Ross and Berger 1996; Sthalekar 1993) Recent work by Law Driediger Hall and Forwell (2006) also suggests that athletes who use imagery to cope with pain are more satisfied with their rehabilitation In rigorous intervention Cupal and Brewer (2001) established that relaxation and imagery can help athletes recovering from ACL reconstructions perceive less pain Participants were also less anxious about re-injuring themselves and gained greater knee strength than two other groups: one no-intervention control group and one placebo group who received attention and encouragement but no PST This is important because few studies have design strong enough to allow us to conclude that PST is truly more effective than simply spending time with an athlete Cupal and Brewer’s (2002) recommendation that more research is required into how such effects are obtained is notable particularly given that another intervention with injured athletes did not observe similar effects (Christakou and Zervas 2007) In this latter study imagery and relaxation had no effect on athletes’ perceptions of pain or edema or range of motion following grade II ankle sprain As the authors suggested the role of different imagery types needs to be more clearly examined in future research For now the simplest recommendation would be for athletes to explore range of (facilitative) images including mental

# Psychological Skills Training in the Rehabilitation Period

Rehearsal-type images and healing images while steering clear of any intrusive debilitative imagery In qualitative interview study with rehabilitating athletes Evans et al (2006) provided some support for this idea and suggested that imagery may change from the early to the late stages of rehabilitation and as result of stress In their study athletes used imagery of skills to promote self-confidence while images of healing and pain management helped the rehabilitation process As an example consider the following quote from male semi-professional soccer player with cartilaginous knee injury:

"I can see the joint itself I can see the bones I can see the ligaments I can imagine where the cartilage is Once I’ve actually got that image in my mind I’ll actually focus on the point where I feel the pain I turn it into color Now the color I usually see it as originally is red right because that’s where the pain is it basically goes from red to orange to yellow to green and through to blue Once I’ve got that blue I just imagine cold icy feeling right which I think tends to help the actual pain at that particular moment" (Evans et al 2006 9)

Another set of psychological skills were used by Beneka and colleagues who investigated the muscular performance of knee injured athletes during rehabilitation (Beneka et al 2000) It was found that athletes taught to use goal setting and self-talk did better at this test than those taught to use just one However it was more beneficial to use either goal setting or self-talk than to do no PST Theodorakis and his colleagues have further established the effectiveness of goal setting in enhancing rehabilitation performance In two separate studies it was found that teaching participants to set personally relevant goals enhanced strength (Theodorakis et al 1996 1997)

# Reduced Fear and Anxiety

When injured performers often suffer from undesirable fear and anxiety (see earlier of this chapter on the psychological reactions to injury) Fortunately PST can be used to decrease these feelings (Suinn 1975; Heil 1993; Ross and Berger 1996) For example it has been found that teenage female gymnasts fear getting injured because it is difficult to return from injury and because being injured prevents them from participating in their sport (Chase et al 2005) Importantly this study also established that psychological skills such as imagery and relaxation could help them overcome such fears A case study with skier (Suinn 1975) found similar results

We know from rehabilitation experts (Udry et al 1997; Karin 2008) that athletes can often return from injury not only physically stronger but also technically better than they previously were Highlight to performers therefore that injury is an almost inescapable part of sustained high-level participation and it should not be seen as inherently negative Instead becoming an expert at injury rehabilitation may be one of the factors that set true high-achievers apart from those who are less able to achieve at high level Alerting athletes to this idea coupled with stories about successfully rehabilitated athletes and PST may help reduce fear and anxiety

# Maintained Well-being

Fortunately PST can support well-being outcomes such as mood and various perceptions of self – perhaps even at the same time as yielding some (or all) of the outcomes outlined above (Evans et al 2000; Johnson 2000; Driediger et al 2006) As an example Johnson (2000) has shown that combination of relaxation and imagery can enhance mood among competitive athletes with long-term injuries Athletes who received this intervention were also more ready to return to competition as judged both by themselves and the physiotherapist treating them Intriguingly Johnson’s (2000) study indicated that the intervention group receiving relaxation and imagery training was the only one to yield statistically significant improvements: those receiving training in stress management and cognitive control or in goal-setting did not Further support for the role of imagery comes from research by Sordoni Hall and Forwell (2002) In their study it was found that healing imagery was positively related to rehabilitation self-efficacy In other words those who did more healing imagery felt more capable of rehabilitating successfully Evans Hare and Mullen (2006) found rehabilitating athletes to use images of sport skills to enhance their confidence

Finally PST may be used to keep motivation up during the drudgery that often accompanies rehabilitation For example one injured athlete put it this way:

"Well for me one is to motivate yourself to make yourself do all of these dumb little exercises that seem at the time that they are not helping you at all"

# Psychology and Sports Rehabilitation

But down the road they will So to try and keep things in perspective you kind of imagine how they’re going to help you get back to competition level (Driediger et al 2006 265)

# Feeling Involved in One's Sport and Maintaining Sport Skills

PST can help an injured performer to feel involved in their sport rather than left out and unable to do anything to progress athletically It can also support the maintenance of sport skills thereby helping athletes return to activity at good level of proficiency (Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Evans et al 2006)

Consider for example the following quote from male international pole vaulter who had used lot of imagery during his rehabilitation from muscular compression injury on his lower back Without any physical training he won National Championship immediately upon his return to activity:

“I’ve done so much imagery between getting injured and now it’s just erm I’m still lot closer to the real performance than I would be if I had done nothing I think that that maybe the reason behind the successful performance in the competition last week in that I mean even though I’d been 2 months without any training at all you know it just kinda came naturally to me it was amazing technically I hadn’t lost thing” (Evans et al 2006 16)

Athletes should be informed that really rehabilitation is busy time - if they choose it to be For example practicing their rehabilitation exercises and practicing mentally is training that can help them progress as athletes Importantly more elite performers are likely to do this automatically while athletes at lower levels may need more inspiration and support (Sordoni et al 2002)

Athletes can be encouraged to do imagery not only at home but also in the practice setting; by sitting in on practices helping out (perhaps by support-coaching others) and learning new skills using their imagery skills an athlete will be in much better position to return to activity when physically strong enough (White and Hardy 1998; Evans et al 2000; Kolt 2000)

The idea of doing imagery in the “right” setting is one of seven recommendations for how to make imagery effective based on the PETTLEP model (Holmes and Collins 2001) Other important considerations raised by this model is that imagery should be multisensory (kinaesthetic imagery appears especially valuable) performed in real time and be updated as performer improves Emphasise that commitment to PST is an important aspect of commitment to sport in general and that by doing it the athletes will return to sport faster

Sometimes injured performers experience debilitative images such as replaying the injury scenario over and over (Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Nordin and Cumming 2005; Evans et al 2006) It is important to realise that this kind of imagery might actually slow down the rehabilitation process (Ievleva and Orlick 1991) and should be avoided Like with self-talk the best way of avoiding unwanted images is to have supply of vivid positive and helpful images available This “supply” will only exist if such images have been practised and so knowing what images help is extra important for this reason When rehearsed the performer will gradually be able to identify debilitative images and replace them with facilitative ones

# Some General Points to Consider

In order for an athlete or rehabilitator to implement successful PST programmes there are some further points to note These include self-determination and injury understanding which are outlined in turn

# Self-Determination

As self-determination theory is gaining more and more research support it is becoming increasingly evident how important it is to encourage sense of self-determination in all aspects of sports and performing and the injury process is no exception (Podlog and Eklund 2007) As noted by Duda et al (2005) and Hardy (2006) PST is likely to be more effective if performers feel that they have say A rehabilitator should therefore be knowledgeable enough about psychological skills to be able to advise performers yet encouraging them to be working in an active autonomous self-determined way This might involve an athlete actively generating their own self-statements images and goals that have relevance to them

# Injury Understanding

As noted by numerous researchers and practitioners (Taylor and Taylor 1997; Green 1999; Williams et al 2001; Morris et al 2005; Evans et al 2006) an understanding of the injury process is crucial for effective rehabilitation

# Physio Knowledge - Rehabilitation Insights

# Some General Points to Consider

Accurate understanding of injury type severity prospects and anatomical structures should aid the rehabilitating athlete in numerous ways For instance it should enhance imagery accuracy and therefore effectiveness (Heil 1993; Price and Andersen 2000) Similarly good understanding of one’s injury will help the athlete set effective self-determined goals related to injury rehabilitation (O’Connor et al 2005)

This may be achieved in number of ways and the rehabilitator should make every effort to interest the athlete in better understanding their relevant anatomy physiology and exercise requirements – skills that are likely to be useful to them even after the injury has healed and helping to prevent re-injury Pictures anatomical models and drawings websites animations interesting anecdotes variations on exercises and generally positive outlook are skills and techniques that may be beneficial

Francis Andersen and Maley (2000) report that athletes often appreciate having timeline ranging from the present to full recovery; this will undoubtedly facilitate accurate goal setting

# Sample PST Programme to Rehabilitate from Injury

1 # Set goals for recovery

Use information from therapists and coaches to set up realistic rehabilitation schedule Then break down your long-term goal (eg being back to playing 100%) into shorter-term goals You may need to do this in several steps; you know you have “done it” when your schedule tells you what to do tomorrow! Set goals that include work such as your rehabilitation exercises (eg leg circles each morning and evening) mental practice (eg 5 minutes of imagery 3x/day) and fun things (eg see teammates socially at least once/week) Get your coach and any rehabilitation personnel to give you regular feedback on how you are doing and bear in mind that goals often need updating as you go along – so stay flexible Again training diary can help you do all this
2 # Use imagery daily

Use imagery to rehearse sport skills and scenarios and to support the healing process It is good idea to imagine yourself as healed strong and back in action; however it might be even better to create realistic gradual images of being stronger and stronger with less and less pain Rehearse reactions to pain and any functional limitations you may expect to have initially Most importantly imagine how you want to cope with such limitations And don’t forget to generate feelings of confidence throughout! Imagery is great way to rehearse emotion as well as more “concrete” things like movements For healing try imagining ultrasound as healing glow or your pain receptors shutting down as result of ice treatment (Heil 1993) or your pain being washed away by water or your blood (Ievleva and Orlick 1991) You can also imagine “breathing into” an area to induce relaxation and feeling of space in joints An imagery script that also includes relaxation procedure is available in Price and Andersen (2000)
3 # Use self-talk to your advantage

Monitor your internal dialogue during rehabilitation ensuring it stays constructive Use it to improve performance in your rehabilitation exercises and perhaps while observing or imagining training sessions and use it to boost your mood and to maintain your confidence throughout the day For instance telling yourself that “of course I am disappointed – but taking time out now to rehabilitate properly will teach me why I got this injury in the first place and avoid re-injury in the future” acknowledges negative emotions such as disappointment while staying constructive
4 # Relax -- you deserve it!

During rehabilitation being able to relax is an important skill – especially for performers who are prone to stress Not only can it help you identify (and release) any excess tension that you are carrying but it can also help you tune into your and thereby enhance awareness – valuable skill also after the injury is gone

# Table 15: SCRAPE Model (Hinderliter and Cardinal 2007)

Concept
Description

Social Support
Athletes with high level of social support from team family or friends demonstrate higher levels of adherence as well as higher motivation and self-esteem

Confidence
This is needed by the athlete towards both the practitioner and the rehabilitation process Through successful accomplishments your athlete will feel sense of achievement autonomy and competence It is helpful for an athlete to maintain an optimistic view especially as within the rehabilitative process there are often setbacks

Refer
This pertains to an ethical and moral sense of obligation by you the sports rehabilitator of the importance of referring to sport psychologist or GP for more serious issues such as depression anxiety or eating disorders This is also another reason why studying psychology is important for rehabilitators: by understanding more about psychological issues you will be in better place to know when you can help an athlete and when they need more specialist support

Accommodate
This refers to being flexible and adjusting to the patient’s needs and wants Beware of relying on standardized approaches and make every effort to develop an individualized programme that suits the athlete

Psychological Skills
These include strategies such as imagery relaxation and goal setting The use of diary is beneficial in helping the athlete to keep record of progress and feelings and can also include instructions for physical and psychological exercises

Educate
The need to educate each client about their specific injury and rehabilitation process is paramount Therefore this part of the SCRAPE acronym refers to the giving of material (eg photocopied pictures of exercises) explaining the nature of the injury or what is required for the treatment or the length of the process

# Bringing it all together: The SCRAPE Model of Psychological Aspects of Recovery

This chapter has contained lot of information and you may be wondering how to remember it all Fortunately help is at hand through SCRAPE: model (Hinderliter and Cardinal 2007) which may help you as sport rehabilitator to easily remember the psychological aspects of recovery The acronym stands for six concepts representing sports rehabilitation recovery including social support confidence and competence refer accommodate psychological skills and educate The model is based on Hinderliter and Cardinal’s (2007) own research as well as their clinical experiences

Finally Williams (2001) summarises the importance of psychology within the sports rehabilitation field when he states that “the ultimate value of research dealing with the psychosocial risk factors is the potential for using the knowledge to reduce the tragedy and expenses caused by avoidable injuries” The integration of psychology within the field of sports rehabilitation is vital for you as practitioner for the teaching and training of sports rehabilitators and for the future development of this profession as whole

This chapter provides an overview analysis and application of clinical reasoning and problem solving skills in the development of professional competencies within the healthcare profession generally and more specifically sports rehabilitation It will help you develop your thinking skills as you progress your reading throughout the book By the end of this chapter you will be able to locate and explain the role and efficacy of clinical reasoning skills within professional practice domain This will inform an appreciation for the complex nature of knowledge construction in relation to clinical explanation and judgement By considering clinical reasoning as functional skill set you will further be in position to explain different models of reasoning and ask structured questions in an attempt to better formulate and construct answers to clinical questions issues and decisions The chapter will further encourage the use of problem solving and clinical reasoning skills to justify substantially through research evidence professional practice actions and outcomes

To adequately define discuss and synthesise clinical reasoning and its application to healthcare practices it is important to relate evidence-based learning and decision making to the skills and competencies of the sports rehabilitator

# Understanding Clinical Reasoning

“It is what we think we know that keeps us from learning” - Claude Bernard

Members of the professions must build and maintain formidable store of knowledge and skills; they must learn to absorb information through various senses and to assess its validity reliability and relevance; and they must acquire the art and culture of their calling And most importantly they must learn to use these qualities to solve practical problems (Heath 1990 cited in Higgs and Jones 1995)

In considering the above it is apparent that clinical reasoning and the application and synthesis of clinical knowledge is at best an obscure and complex phenomenon It involves complex process of structuring meaning from confusing data and experiences occurring within specific clinical setting and then making informed judgements based on understanding and evidence-based practices

# What is Clinical Reasoning?

Clinical reasoning may be defined as “the process of applying knowledge and expertise to clinical situation to develop solution” (Carr 2004)

# Clinical Reasoning

# Clinical Reasoning

Several forms of reasoning exist and each has its own merits and uses Reasoning involves the processes of cognition and metacognition In sports rehabilitation clinical reasoning skills are an expected component of expert and competent practice Interprofessional health research predominantly from nursing practices have identified concepts processes and thinking strategies that might underpin the clinical reasoning used by healthcare professionals

Much of the available research on reasoning is based on the use of the think aloud approach Although this is useful method it is dependent on the ability to describe and verbalise the reasoning process (Schon 1991; Hauer et al 2007) Information-processing theory developed by Newell and Simon (1972) is useful in explaining and describing how to organise information using knowledge and experience and the use of cognitive processes to resolve problem Rather than analysing how problem ought to be solved or decision made this theory describes decision making as an open system of interaction between problem solver and task (Ericsson and Simon 1984; Simmons et al 2003) This theory is useful in helping to describe and categorise the organisation of problem solving and decision making for clinical reasoning development According to Simmons et al (2003) when applied in healthcare settings the term information processing becomes interchangeable with clinical reasoning

Is clinical reasoning simply the collection and collation of data in an attempt to provide answers to often complex questions? Is it the barrier between expertise knowledge and novice enterprise? Or is clinical reasoning and subsequent applications more involved process of knowing appraising and deciding how best to answer?

In support of the latter the area of evidence-based learning captures the nature of clinical enquiry through simple question: What is the best possible answer that can be given based on current knowledge levels? This question triggers complex cerebral cascade that demands substantiated support often through scientific and research-driven processes to arrive at an answer that fully and comprehensively details specific knowledge cluster It is this process of thinking through reason that allows clinician to consolidate appreciate and apply knowledge in relation to clinical challenges

The literature is flooded with examples and extensions of clinical and problem-solving skills and decisions with an array of application and analysis Despite this there is no one accepted evidence-based research model to adequately explain or account for all aspects of clinical reasoning practices There are number of models that attempt to explain the interdependent process of thinking through reasoning to arrive at an informed answer to substantiate action Fleming and Mattingly (1994) argue that clinical reasoning in its most simple is “judgement in action” leading to “action based upon judgement”

# Models of Clinical Reasoning

Appreciating the challenge and process of clinical reasoning often demands an understanding and analysis of models of clinical reasoning The generation of hypotheses based on clinical data and knowledge coupled with the testing of these hypotheses through further inquiry forms the basis of the hypothetico-deductive reasoning model (Elstein et al 1978; Kassirer and Gorry 1978; Gale 1982) Hypothesis generation and testing involves both inductive (considering specific observation and moving to more general view) and deductive (moving from generalised view to more specific and pronounced outcome) reasoning (Ridderrikhoff 1989) Induction is reasoning process used in the formulation of hypotheses whereas deduction is used to test the hypothesis Inductive reasoning is probabilistic in nature since conclusion is reached and the presented evidence is evaluated in relation to existing knowledge (Albert et al 1988) Deductive reasoning is widely used in sports rehabilitation practice to defend decisions and actions

A second explanation of how reasoning is used to support actions and decisions is contained within pattern recognition approach Pattern recognition or more precisely inductive reasoning as an interpretation and expression of diagnostic reasoning has received much support in the literature (Hamilton 1966; Gorry 1970; Elstein et al 1990)

This reasoning approach allows more experienced practitioners to arrange their thought processes into patterned formations This development of pattern formation allows for heuristic analysis in clinical judgements Pattern recognition further allows clinicians to draw on past treatments to better evaluate their effectiveness and categorise the success of the treatment into management plan for the treatment of similar or recurring condition

In their study researchers employed an objective measure called the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory to quantitatively measure critical thinking The inventory has several subscales that depict the components of critical analysis The weakest subscale was that of truth seeking which highlights the ability of critical thinker to reflect on knowledge and engage in quest to find the truth irrespective of current views The reasons attributed to the weakness in the truth scale could be explained by emphasizing the need to know the correct answer as opposed to understanding the reasons for the correct answer and the ability to reflect on the answers reached

While this chapter does not explore critical thinking as separate entity from clinical reasoning knowledge of critical analysis and reflection is central to developing skills necessary for understanding clinical decisions and actions

# Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

One possible approach to teaching and developing reasoning skills is problem-based learning (PBL) PBL has its history firmly rooted within the teaching and education of medical practitioners although its application to other disciplines has been researched and documented (Wood 2003) PBL evolved through two assumptions: the first was that learning through problem solving is more effective than memory-based learning for creating usable of knowledge; the second was that clinical skills which are important for patient treatment are problem-solving skills not necessarily memory skills

PBL is not merely method but total teaching approach that reflects the way learners learn in real-life situations It has been used in varied study contexts to develop critical analysis and thought as well as problem-solving skills (Duncan et al 2007) Through the use of PBL within the sports rehabilitation curriculum it is hypothesized that the cardinal skills of critical thinking analysis and application will develop leading to greater levels of student intrinsic motivation

Using PBL with undergraduate students could enable the growth and evolution of critical analysis (Martin et al 2008) One of the primary features of PBL is that it is student-centered referring to learning opportunities that are relevant to the students the goals of which are at least partly determined by the students themselves

# Clinical Reasoning

The students themselves Creating assignments and activities that require student also increases the likelihood of students being motivated to learn (Richardson 2005) A common criticism of student-centred learning is that students as novices cannot be expected to know what might be important for them to learn especially in subject to which they appear to have no prior exposure The literature on novice-expert learning does not entirely dispute this assertion; rather it does emphasise that our students come to us not as the proverbial blank slates but as individuals whose prior learning can greatly impact their current learning

Problem based learning (PBL) encourages students to use and develop knowledge by examining problems or case study scenarios in relevant real-life and applied context (Martin et al 2008) Like many of the teaching approaches PBL needs to be used carefully especially in the design of the problem Savin-Baden (2003) noted that PBL is an approach to learning that is characterised by flexibility and diversity in the sense that it can be implemented in variety of ways across subjects and disciplines in diverse contexts As such it can therefore look different to different people at different times depending on the staff and students using it What is unique and yet similar is the locus of learning around problem scenarios rather than discrete subject areas (Duncan et al 2007)

Savery (2006) notes that the widespread adoption of the PBL instructional approach by different disciplines for different age levels and in different content domains has produced some misapplications and misconceptions of PBL Certain practices that are called PBL may fail to achieve the anticipated learning outcomes for variety of reasons:

- Confusing PBL as an approach to curriculum design with the teaching of problem-solving
- Adoption of PBL proposal without sufficient commitment of staff at all levels
- Lack of research and development on the nature and type of problems to be used
- Insufficient investment in the design preparation and ongoing renewal of learning resources
- Inappropriate assessment methods which do not match the learning outcomes sought in problem-based programmes
- Evaluation strategies that do not focus on the key learning issues and which are implemented and acted on far too late

Using PBL in developing clinical reasoning skills is useful Unlike traditional information driven curricula PBL begins with problem often based on real facts or simulations of real situations and requires the student to work alone and in groups to find solutions The advantage is that real problems do not have simple solutions and require comparison and analysis of resources As such the student develops skills of retrieval selection and discrimination and applies these to reason through answers and solutions to problems (Duncan et al 2007) PBL is one way in which clinical reasoning skills can be developed

To develop an appreciation of the dynamics of PBL within the evolution of clinical reasoning skills it is important to briefly address two important concepts that directly impact this evolutionary process namely: Troublesome knowledge (TK) and threshold concepts (TCs) It is not the intention of this chapter to analyse these concepts in depth nor to critique their application but to rather introduce them as important considerations in the development of clinical reasoning knowledge

Meyers and Land (2003) related definitional construct of threshold concepts by outlining that in each discipline such as sports rehabilitation there are conceptual gateways or portals that must be negotiated to arrive at important new understandings In crossing the portal or threshold transformation occurs in both knowledge and subjectivity Meyers and Land (2008) and Land et al (2008) expand this further by detailing the transformation as irreversible (no-going back) and integrative (involving the inclusion and fusion of different ideas and concepts in both detail and variation) Such transformation involves troublesome knowledge

Perkins (1999) referred to troublesome knowledge as knowledge that is alien or counter-intuitive ritualised inert tacit or academically challenging Perkins further relates that threshold concepts could lead to troublesome knowledge within their own rights

Sports rehabilitation and injury prevention as subject area and professional practice is troublesome within itself The scope of practice content of learning curriculum map and clinical competencies may

# 6D Approach to Knowledge Development

Dissect: Breaking information down into usable clusters

Digest: Absorbing the information and sifting through its relevance

Discern: Deciding on information importance

Debate: Argument both internal and external around how best to use the information in the formulation of decision and/or action

Develop: Evolution of new knowledge or way of thinking and/or practice and using this knowledge to inform decisions

Decision: Acting on the information and instructing an intervention

OUTCOME: The resulting action

This model emphasises the progressive and somewhat difficult steps one needs to take to consider solutions to issues that could prove to be troublesome The threshold depicted after one discerns information is portal into an internal and often external debate around using information to develop new ways of thinking and decision making The entire model is informed by evaluation of action and resultant outcome

At times it can be conceptually and practically difficult to identify and embed into distinct clinical practice model that stands unique from similar clinical and healthcare practices The explanation of the field of sports rehabilitation involves defending scope of practice that is construed by some professionals and clinicians as alien or subset of physiotherapy practice yet surprisingly different To fully consider action and decision making within sports rehabilitation and the ensuing development of clinical reasoning skills it is fundamental that clinicians academics and students identify the threshold concepts and then use approaches such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to navigate Threshold Knowledge (TK) and Threshold Concepts (TC) to develop reflective ways of thinking and practice The ability to think and reason like professional clinician is an important goal of the sports rehabilitation student

The model integrates TCs and TKs into clinical reasoning development framework and considers 6-D approach in defining conceptual difficulties and thresholds This model develops progressive strategy for thinking about action and clinical decision making Säljö (1979) provides useful analysis of learning as developmental learning concept leading to change in personal identity

# Clinical Reasoning in Sports Rehabilitation

# Understanding Clinical Reasoning

Clinical reasoning is the ability to master the strategies and competencies to think like sports rehabilitator To achieve this learning must be aligned with understanding The conceptual models align to illustrate the process of transformation and the traversing of TCs and TK

The true characteristics of proficient sports rehabilitator practitioner lie in the ability to cross thresholds integrate new knowledge and construct bridges between the concepts to arrive at informed and evidence-based decisions and actions (Barrows and Pickell 1991)

# Challenges in Clinical Reasoning

In recent study by Hauer et al (2007) on the effect of causal knowledge on judgments of the likelihood of unknown features the researchers reported that respondents perceived that technique problems in history taking and physical examination were readily correctable but that poor performance resulting from inadequate knowledge or poor clinical reasoning ability was more difficult to ameliorate Interpersonal skill deficiencies which often manifested as detachment from the patient and professionalism problems attributed to lack of insight were mostly refractory to remediation

A possible explanation for this discrepancy could lie in the way in which problem solving/clinical reasoning skills are taught at an undergraduate level of training Traditional approaches to teaching clinical skills are often based on the assumption that clinical reasoning is skill divorced from content knowledge Although clinical reasoning skills and clinical knowledge could be developed and delivered separately there is support for an integrated approach to improve the organization and structure of relevant clinical knowledge and practices (Barrows and Pickell 1991)

# Smart Action in Professional Practice

Sports rehabilitation clinicians work within framework of problematic situations Many of these situations can be characterized by complexity ambiguity doubt and uniqueness With this known entity it may be better to conceptualize the skills required for professional practice and competency in terms of smart action as opposed to clinical reasoning Differentiating the two at this level allows for centered approach in dealing with judgment and decision making within specific context and time

In other words smart action implies making the best decision under given set of circumstances It does not however mean always taking the right action Smart action skills are often the catalyst for reflective analysis of performance The evolution of this process provides the basis for professional development and critical awareness in decision making

# Developing Clinical Reasoning Skills

An important aspect of the development of higher cognitive skills and clinical reasoning ability is the ability to construct and use knowledge The construction of knowledge requires an interpretation and processing of experience in order to appreciate reality This often involves developing constructs to help understand reality and interpretation of experience One cannot divorce thinking from the process and that knowledge development requires thought critical analysis and self-reflection on and of the knowledge construct

The next will tease out the key elements that need consideration and development in mastering clinical reasoning skills

# Improving Clinical Reasoning

In order to become better firstly we need to decide what needs improving The majority of available research on clinical reasoning concludes that three processes interact in order to bring about good quality clinical reasoning (Higgs and Jones 2000; Higgs and Titchen 2001)

These three processes are knowledge cognition and metacognition These three interact throughout the process of receiving interpreting processing and utilizing clinical information during decision making clinical intervention and reflection on actions and outcomes

# Types of Knowledge

Knowledge is essential for reasoning and decision making with knowledge and clinical reasoning being interdependent phenomena There are two broad categories of knowledge:

- Propositional knowledge (“knowing that”): Achieved through research and scholarship (reading and being taught) and involves generalizing information looking for cause and effect relationships
- Non-propositional knowledge (“knowing how”): Gained through practice experience It would appear therefore that background knowledge is important but this must be task specific

It is not the way problems are tackled nor the thoroughness of the investigations nor the use of problem-solving strategies but the ability to activate the knowledge that is crucial for effective clinical reasoning

# Clinical Reasoning in Physiotherapy

# How Can We Become Better at Clinical Reasoning?

Pertinent knowledge as consequence of situational demands distinguishes experienced from inexperienced physicians (Custers et al 1992)

This ability to have and be able to recall task-specific knowledge is one of the elements that marks out an experienced practitioner from novice one They are able to bring together many key elements of knowledge; anatomy physiology biomechanics pathology etc and link them together to provide rational explanation of the problem with which they are presented This is often coupled with their practice experience (knowing how to do things) which then allows for superior management of the patient This use of knowledge is very much coupled to the process of reflection which is covered in the next 

# Cognition and Metacognition

Cognition is the act of thinking with metacognition being the awareness and monitoring of cognition; that is thinking about thinking These two elements are integrated into clinical reasoning through the process of reflection Reflection is an activity in which people recapture their experience think about it mull it over and evaluate it Reflection itself involves two different aspects: reflection in action and reflection about action

Reflection in action involves thinking about what you are doing For example whilst carrying out Lachman’s test at the knee the practitioner should be reflecting on “Is this what I expected to find? If it isn’t why isn’t it?” Reflection about action is essentially thinking about what has happened after it has happened with questions such as “What was good about what I did? What was bad? What can I improve for next time? What do I need to take away from the experience and store to use again?”

Reflection is the key to information processing in clinical reasoning From strong knowledge base patterns can be identified; by reflecting in action the strength of the patterns' relationship to the presenting problem can be tested Reflection in action allows the solving of problems when the presentation does not fit pattern through hypothetico-deductive reasoning Finally to complete the process reflection about action becomes process whereby those experiences can be stored and used to generate future patterns

# The Process of Clinical Reasoning

The process of clinical reasoning involves the testing of hypotheses in order to discover what patient’s problem is and develop an appropriate management strategy There are number of potential categories that this hypothesis can fit into including:

- Source of symptoms
- Mechanism of symptoms
- Contributing factors
- Precautions and contraindications
- Management and treatment
- Prognosis

The source of symptoms can be considered by using component model (see Figure 163) The source of symptoms can either be local to the site of pain or remote from the site of pain but capable of referring pain to the area of the pain The mechanism of symptoms is what has caused the pain; this could be from an extrinsic source such as kick or fall or it could be from an intrinsic source such as overuse injuries where the tissues become overloaded and break down

The contributing factors are those factors that predispose the patient to the mechanism of injury occurring; they could include poor proprioception muscle imbalances shortened soft tissue structures or even lack of fitness and skill The precautions and contraindications are those factors that might limit any chosen course of action because of potential harm to the patient The management and treatment hypothesis category is generating plan for the patient which where possible takes into account all of the above For instance not just treating the local source of symptoms but also those remote symptoms which could perpetuate the problem whilst also addressing any contributing factors that may cause the problem to reoccur or not be able to be resolved

Finally the prognosis takes into account all of the above: how long will it take for the patient to get better? How much better will they get? And how long will it take? Some of this information will come from knowledge some from reflecting on the findings of the examination (reflection in action) and the progression of any treatments

(Reflection in and about action) and finally from collating the experiences of treating other patients and applying that information (reflection about action) In summary open-mindedness the questioning of existing beliefs and reflective thinking are essential for good clinical reasoning to work

# Example

Using the example in Figure 163 it can be seen that the potential sources of the symptom of posterior thigh pain are multiple If we take the simplest option in terms of differential diagnosis such as strain of hamstring muscles as the injury the first thing we need to do is discount the other sources of symptoms

For example in order to discount the lumbar spine sacroiliac and hip joints these joints must have full pain-free range of movement the spinal and peripheral nerves must on tensile loading show no mechano-sensitivity and the other muscles must have full range of movement and no pain on contraction

The hamstring muscle group shows pain on contraction and elongation (stretch) along with pain on palpation The typical mechanism of injury for hamstring injury is one of sudden onset of pain during an eccentric contraction to decelerate knee extension during the swing phase whilst sprinting If any other mechanism occurred then this must be clarified to make sure it fits with one which would result in hamstring muscle injury

There are number of factors that can contribute to the occurrence of hamstring muscle injury one is previous history of hamstring injury another is age; older athletes are more likely to have hamstring strain Further contributory factors are strength imbalances between the quadriceps and hamstrings altered mechano-sensitivity of the sciatic nerve and degenerative change in the lumbar spine

Assuming there are no contraindications and precautions to treatment the management and treatment can be planned The treatment needs to be directed not only at the local cause of symptoms; the hamstrings in this case (though remote causes may have to be dealt with in other cases) but also at the predisposing factors to prevent any reoccurrence

So the strength of the tissue (its tolerance to load) will need to be gradually increased along with its tolerance to elongation In doing this its ability to tolerate eccentric load will need special attention and be brought to level in balance with quadriceps concentric strength Simultaneously mobility of the sciatic nerve and lumbar spine must be maintained to reduce the influence of these factors on any future injury

To conceptualise the clinical decisions considered within the above example it may be useful to use the 6D approach depicted in Figure 162 The example considers posterior thigh pain from multiple perspectives and encourages fusion of thought and argument to best decide on effective management

Using the 6D approach the clinician firstly needs to dissect knowledge on posterior thigh pain aetiology and consider the numerous sources of the pain This component will draw on anatomical landscapes of the posterior thigh region The next phase will drive the clinician to consider which information sets are most useful in digesting the issues confronting the cause of the pain

Once considered process of discerning information in this case consideration of the hamstring mechanism of action and functionality may be most important clinically to develop an appropriate treatment and management plan for the pain These decisions drawn from sequential analysis of knowledge and anatomical architecture allow the clinician to cross threshold into different and often new way of thinking about the presenting issues and problems

This threshold crossing may be transformative and irreversible and the clinician may now be forced to live with the decisions made and actions taken The later phase of the 6D approach teases out how the clinician chooses to defend the actions based on the knowledge organisation from the presenting issue

In summary the example presented above can be divided into two important clinical reasoning processes The first is understanding the issue or problem and using prior learning or experiential knowledge to develop plan of action and treatment The second involves the cognitive processes of higher-order reasoning to defend and justify clinically the decisions made and actions taken The entire process is fuelled by an evaluation of the outcome

# Model Overview

The model in Figure 164 used extensively in action research and developed by Susman (1983) is useful in providing an alternative analysis and conceptual map for the example on posterior thigh pain The model depicts progress process-driven approach in helping the clinician organise thinking into practice and management plan for action

This chapter outlines the anatomy of the shoulder girdle and discusses commonly presenting pathology around this area Common orthopaedic assessment tests are described together with presentation of the effectiveness of these tests in assessing for specific diagnoses of commonly presenting pathology from currently available literature The role of rehabilitation is covered with analysis of the function of commonly utilised exercise and the role of clinical reasoning in determining the diagnosis and formulating safe and effective rehabilitation programme

# Incidence of Shoulder Injury

The glenohumeral joint is one of the most frequently injured areas of the upper extremity in competitive sports Studies indicate that 8–20% of athletic injuries involve the glenohumeral joint (Hill 1983; Lo et al 1990; Hutson 1996; Terry and Chopp 2000; Ranson and Gregory 2008)

Athletes whose sports require large amount of time with their arms above the level of the shoulder such as those playing racquet sports sports involving throwing (baseball cricket American Football and water polo) swimmers and rugby players (due to their arm position within the tackle) commonly report high incidence of shoulder pain with up to 438% reporting shoulder pain (Lo et al 1990) Hutson (1996) reported that more than 40% of elite swimmers complained of shoulder pain at some point during their careers and this was related to the fact that 90% of the propulsive force comes from the upper extremity (Counsilman 1977) with the main cause of pain being attributed to glenohumeral joint instability (Weldon and Richardson 2001) due to significantly increased humeral head translation (Tibone et al 2002)

In American Football 152% of all injuries incurred by quarterbacks were shoulder injuries with direct trauma being responsible for 823% of the shoulder injuries (Kelly et al 2004) In professional cricket 23% of players in one study reported suffering shoulder injury during one professional season (Ranson and Gregory 2008)

The epidemiology of Rugby Union and Rugby League injuries appears to suggest that injury to the shoulder accounts for approximately 12–16% of all injuries with an incidence of 10–13 per 1000 game hours with this statistic higher when compared to pre-professionalism incidence rates (Garraway and Macleod 1995; Bird et al 1998; Gabbet 2000; Chalmers et al 2001; Lee et al 2001; Gissane et al 2003; Junge et al 2004; Handcock et al 2005) With regards to Rugby Union Bathgate et al (2002) highlighted the upper limb as responsible for 154% of injuries with 63% of overall injuries located at the shoulder

Even within non-overhead sports such as skiing shoulder injuries have been reported as high as 114% of all injuries (Kocher 1996)

# Table 171: Static Stabilisers of the Glenohumeral Joint

|Ligament|Description|Action|
|---|---|---|
|Superior Glenohumeral Ligament|Attaches from the supraglenoid tubercle of the glenoid labrum onto the proximal tip of the lesser tuberosity of the humerus|Resists inferior humeral translation with the arm adducted and in neutral rotation Limits external rotation in conjunction with the coracohumeral ligament|
|Middle Glenohumeral Ligament|Attaches from the supraglenoid tubercle and anterior aspect of glenoid labrum onto the lesser tuberosity of the humerus blending with the subscapularis tendon|Provides anterior humeral stability from humeral adduction to approximately 45 degrees abduction|
|Inferior Glenohumeral Ligament Complex|- Anterior band: from anterior labrum to the glenoid rim
- Middle band: is an axillary pouch
- Posterior band: from the posterior labrum to the glenoid rim Not found in all patients
|- From 0 to 30 degrees humeral abduction the anterior band is the primary static stabiliser of the glenohumeral joint It tightens with abduction and moves superiorly with combined external rotation to become the primary anterior humeral stabiliser in this position
- The primary static stabiliser with the arm in flexion and medial rotation providing posterior stability It tightens with abduction and moves superiorly with combined internal rotation
|
|Coracohumeral Ligament|Lateral aspect of the coracoid process of the scapula onto the upper facet of the greater tuberosity of the humerus blending with the supraspinatus tendon|Resists posterior and inferior translation of the suspended shoulder; it is an inferior stabiliser and tightens with external rotation|
|Glenoid Labrum|A fibrocartilaginous rim attached around the margin of the glenoid cavity attached to the circumference of the glenoid while the free edge is thin and sharp It is continuous with the tendon of the long head of biceps|It deepens the articular cavity and protects the edges of the bone|

Repetitive overhead stress within the overhead athlete challenges the functional dynamic integrity of the glenohumeral joint within these athletes As there is little bony contact between the head of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the scapula there is great range of mobility at the joint with an inherent instability of the articulation (Armfield et al 2003) Joint homeostasis is maintained by the harmonious static and dynamic interaction of the muscles ligaments and joint capsule The static stabilisers of the joint consist of the labrum capsule and ligaments while the dynamic stabilisers of the joint are the muscles of the rotator cuff deltoid and scapular stabilisers (Terry and Chopp 2000; Woodward and Best 2000) Lack of ability to maintain the humeral head centred within the glenoid fossa during movement is defined as instability (Magarey and Jones 1992)

Hess (2000) adapted Panjabi’s model proposed for spinal segmental stability (Panjabi 1992) for the glenohumeral joint which states that joint stability is based on the interaction between the active passive and neural control subsystems with the rotator cuff muscles activating at different positions compressing the convex humeral head into the concave glenoid thus resisting the shear force experienced by the humeral head (Lee et al 2000) Receptors within the joint capsule contribute to reflex arc which will cause activation of the muscles which overlie the joint capsule (Guanche et al 1995)

# Overview of Shoulder Injuries

Overhead athletes suffer repeated microtrauma resulting from repetitive use of the limb at extreme ranges of motions without increasing force Instability can result from muscle imbalance contracture and ligamentous and capsular laxity (Cofield et al 1993) Range of motion deficits will contribute to injury as this will produce situation whereby some muscles become tight and some muscles become lax (Baltaci and Johnson 2001) Patients with chronic shoulder pain or instability are sometimes difficult to diagnose and treat A thorough history and systematic clinical examination followed by

# Assessment of Injury Risk

# Assessment of Injury Risk

The assessment of posture within the domain of injury rehabilitation has traditionally been performed via visual observation of specific joints/bony landmarks and the corresponding position they have to one another Good posture has been described as state of muscular and skeletal balance that protects the supporting structures of the against injury or progressive deformity irrespective of the attitudes in which the structures are resting or working (Kendall et al 1993)

Ideal alignment standards used in clinical practice have previously been highlighted (Kendall et al 1993; Sahrmann 2002) The widely accepted description of normal standing posture is that proposed by Kendall and McCreary (1983) as vertical line passing through the lobe of the ear the seventh cervical vertebra acromion process greater trochanter and slightly anterior to the midlines of the knee and lateral malleolus Deviations outside this theoretical plumb-line have been described as abnormal and have been linked to numerous problems

Posture deviations frequently found in the cervical and thoracic spine have been suggested to affect the normal function of the glenohumeral joint (Ayub 1991; Kendall et al 1993; Einhorn et al 1997; Janda 2002; Sahrmann 2002; Lewis et al 2005a)

# Postural Deviations

Standing postures associated with forward head are seen in association with combinations of increased lordosis in the cervical and lumbar regions an increased kyphosis in the thoracic region protracted shoulders (with elevation or depression) and abnormal scapula position (Ayub 1991; Greenfield et al 1995; Grimsby and Gray 1997; McDonnell and Sahrmann 2002; Sahrmann 2002; McDonnell et al 2005) although not all studies have found this (Raine and Twomey 1997; Hanten et al 2000)

Several authors have suggested that muscle imbalances and shortening can occur in the sternocleidomastoid upper trapezius and levator scapula with forward head position This will lead to elevated and abducted scapula and increased thoracic kyphosis increasing the risk of impingement (Ayub 1991; Grimsby and Gray 1997)

Subjects with increased thoracic kyphosis have been shown to predispose altered scapular kinematics; when asymptomatic subjects were positioned in slouched posture when sitting and instructed to elevate their arm there was significant reduction in posterior tilt and upward rotation of the scapula as well as an increase in the amount of scapular elevation and internal rotation (Kebaetse et al 1999)

When subjects who were experiencing sub acromial impingement improved their posture it was not found to have significant effect on the intensity of the pain but increased the range of shoulder elevation before the pain was experienced (Lewis et al 2005a) Thus thoracic posture needs to be optimised in patients with impingement-like symptoms during all daily activities and exercises directed at improving thoracic extension should be considered

# Interventions

Interventions to consider are amongst others:

- Thoracic spine joint mobilization (Bang and Deyle 2000)
- Corrective taping of the scapular and thoracic spine (Lewis et al 2005b)
- Facilitation of scapulothoracic musculature (Konrad et al 2006)
- Facilitate the activity of the rotator cuff (Magarey and Jones 2003)

# Shoulder Girdle Scapular and Glenohumeral Joint Position

The role of the scapula is extremely important in providing stable base from which the glenohumeral joint functions as well as determining the overall position of the shoulder girdle (Kibler 1991; Paine and Voight 1993; Kibler 1998; Sahrmann 2002; Magarey and Jones 2003) The efficiency of muscular activity is dependent on the position of the scapula and the length-tension relationships of the scapular stabilisers and rotator cuff muscles which originate on the scapula cervical and/or thoracic spine (Einhorn et al 1997; Mottram 1997; Magarey and Jones 2003)

The scapula stabilisers such as trapezius and serratus anterior can be adversely affected by common abnormal postures such as increased thoracic kyphosis and forward head positions (Greenfield et al 1995; Ludewig and Cook 2000; Borstad and Ludewig 2005; Lewis et al 2005a) Certain muscle imbalances particularly shortening can occur in the sternocleidomastoid upper trapezius and levator scapula with forward head position leading to increased thoracic kyphosis and elevated or depressed abducted scapula (Ayub 1991; Grimsby and Gray 1997)

This increased thoracic kyphosis causes the scapula to become abducted due to lengthening of the rhomboid and lower trapezius muscles whilst shortening the serratus anterior latissimus dorsi subscapularis teres major and pectoralis major and minor muscles and pulling the humerus into an anterior and/or internally rotated position and further anteriorly tilting the scapula (Ayub 1991; Borstad and Ludewig 2005) This posture alters the scapulohumeral rhythm and perpetuates various forms of impingements either in the subacromial space or inter-articular during arm elevation as the ability of the scapula to tilt posteriorly is inhibited by overactive pectoralis minor (Lewis et al 2005a)

# Active Movements

Active tests do not enable us to differentiate between inert and contractile structures Active tests inform us about the patient’s willingness to move

# Passive Movements

Test the integrity of the inert structures Look for pain range of movement and end-feel

# Resisted Tests

Maximal isometric contractions from neutral generally mid-range position: Examine the contractile structures assess pain and muscle strength

# Palpation

# Abnormal Findings:

At rest: warmth fluid synovial thickening
On movement: crepitus end-feel

# End-Feel

# Normal/Physiological:

Hard: eg elbow extension knee extension
Capsular (elastic): eg rotations at shoulder elbow hip
Extra-articular (tissue approximation): flexion at elbow hip

# Pathological:

Too hard: eg osteoarthrosis
Too soft: eg loose in the elbow joint
Muscle spasm (involuntary muscle contraction): eg arthritis
Empty (voluntary muscle contraction not always the same range): eg abscess
Springy block: eg meniscus subluxation

# Special Tests

There are many special tests for evaluation of the pathologies arising around the glenohumeral joint and there have been numerous articles evaluating the sensitivity and specificity as well the positive and negative likelihood ratios (Dinnes et al 2003; Hegedus et al 2008; Munro and Healy 2008) Sensitivity is the ability to identify everyone with specific condition Specificity is the proportion of patients without specific condition who have negative test A positive likelihood ratio describes the impact that positive test has on raising the suspicion that

# Assessment of Injury Risk

Condition actually exists High values infer that the condition which is being tested for really exists Conversely low negative likelihood ratio infers that the condition for which is being tested is likely not to exist

Several authors (Razmjou et al 2004; Boettcher et al 2008; Hegedus et al 2008; Munro and Healy 2009) have analysed the pooled results of studies and have come to the same conclusion; the commonly utilised diagnostic tests for shoulder pathology have low diagnostic utility

Below is description of some of the more common tests for various pathologies arising around the shoulder Since there are several tests described for the various pathologies it is indicative that there is no superior test for any single pathology

# Common Tests for Shoulder Pathologies

# Anterior Instability

# Anterior Load and Shift Test (Hawkins et al 1996)

The humeral head is grasped with one hand while the other hand stabilises the scapula The humeral head is loaded medially into the joint and then an anterior and posterior shearing force is applied The direction and translation can be graded using Altchek and Dines classification (1993) scale of 0 to 3

# Anterior Drawer Test (Gerber and Ganz 1984)

The patient is placed supine and the arm abducted over the edge of the plinth The examiner stabilises the scapula with one arm whilst the other grasps the humeral head and translates it in an anteromedial direction on the glenoid Unilateral increases in humeral head translation of the symptomatic shoulder indicate anterior glenohumeral joint instability

# Relocation Test

With the patient supine the arm is taken into abduction and external rotation The test can be augmented by pushing the humeral head anteriorly from behind The relocation test is performed by pushing posteriorly on the upper part of the humerus The relocation test is positive if the apprehension or pain is relieved

# Posterior Instability

# Posterior Load and Shift – Posterior Drawer Test (Gerber and Ganz 1984)

This test is similar to the anterior drawer test and the humeral head is translated in posterolateral direction

# Apprehension Test (Jobe et al 1989)

This is performed with the humerus in 90 degrees of abduction 90 degrees of elbow flexion and external rotation of the shoulder The examiner exerts gentle pressure into progressive external rotation A positive test is when the patient feels sensation of impending dislocation

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

# Posterior Apprehension Test

This is modification of the posterior draw test described by Gerber and Gantz (1984) where the arm is adducted and flexed to 90 degrees whilst the examiner imparts an axial posterolaterally directed force to the humerus A positive result is that of pain apprehension and often the feeling of click as the humerus rides over the posterior rim of the glenoid

# Inferior Laxity

# The Sulcus Sign (Neer and Foster 1980)

This is an examination to determine the extent and/or presence of inferior instability of the glenohumeral joint This test can be administered with the patient either seated or standing with their arm relaxed at their side The examiner palpates the shoulder by placing thumb and fingers on the anterior and posterior aspects of the humeral head The examiner grasps the patient’s elbow with their other hand and applies downward distraction force A positive test will result in sulcus being formed between the acromion and the humeral head as the humeral head moves inferiorly while the force is being applied

# SLAP Lesions

# O'Brien Test (O'Brien et al 1998)

The patient’s shoulder is held in 90 degrees of forward flexion 30–45 degrees of horizontal adduction and maximal internal rotation The examiner exerts downward force distal to the patient’s elbow which the patient tries to resist The patient is asked to identify if produced the location of the pain The test is repeated in the same position except that this time the humerus is externally rotated and the forearm supinated so the palm faces up Once again downward force is applied by the examiner which the patient actively resists and the patient is asked to identify the location of any pain provoked The test is considered positive if pain produced during the first part of the test is abolished with the second part of the test For indication of SLAP tear the pain is located over the anterior aspect of the shoulder and for AC joint pathology the pain must be located over the AC joint

# Anterior Slide (Kibler 1995b)

The patient stands with hands on hips One of the examiner’s hands is placed over the shoulder and the other hand behind the elbow A force is then applied anteriorly and superiorly and the patient is asked to push back against the force The test is positive if pain is localized to the front of the shoulder or click is experienced by the patient

# Assessment of Injury Risk

# Crank Test (Liu et al 1996)

With the patient upright or supine and the arm elevated to 160 degrees in the plane of the scapula joint load is applied along the axis of the humerus with one hand whilst the other hand performs humeral rotation A positive test is reproduction of the patient’s overhead symptoms (with or without click)

# Posterior Slide Test

# Biceps Load Test I (Kim et al 1999)

The test is performed with the patient in the supine position The examiner sits adjacent to the patient on the same side as the affected shoulder and gently grasps the patient’s wrist and elbow The arm to be examined is abducted at 90 degrees with the forearm in the supinated position

The patient is allowed to relax and an anterior apprehension test is performed When the patient becomes apprehensive during the external rotation of the shoulder external rotation is stopped The patient is then asked to flex the elbow while the examiner resists the flexion with one hand If the apprehension is lessened or if the patient feels more comfortable than before the test the test is negative for SLAP lesion If the apprehension has not changed or if the shoulder becomes more painful the test is positive

# Pain Provocation Test (Mimori et al 1999)

The patient is seated with the arm in 90 degrees abduction and 90 degrees external rotation and the elbow flexed to 90 degrees The examiner places one hand over the scapula whilst the other hand holds the patient’s wrist The patient is then asked to supinate and pronate the forearm If the pain is worse on pronation this is indicative of SLAP tear

# Resisted Supination External Rotation Test (Myers et al 2005)

The patient is placed in the supine position on the examination bed with the scapula near the edge of the bed The examiner stands at the patient’s side supporting the affected arm at the elbow and hand with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees the elbow flexed 65–70 degrees and the forearm in neutral or slight pronation The patient then attempts to supinate the hand with maximal effort against the examiner’s resistance

The patient forcefully supinates the hand against resistance as the shoulder is gently externally rotated to the end of range They are then asked to describe the symptoms at maximum external rotation The test is positive if the patient experiences anterior or deep shoulder pain clicking or catching in the shoulder or reproduction of symptoms that occurred during throwing The test is negative if the patient described posterior shoulder pain apprehension or no pain

# Biceps Load Test II (Kim et al 2001)

The patient is tested in supine The arm is abducted to 120 degrees externally rotated maximally elbow in 90 degrees flexion and forearm supinated If this test position reproduces pain then perform active elbow flexion against resistance If the active elbow flexion component of the test increases pain (or produces pain) the test is positive

# Long Head of the Biceps

# Yergason’s Test (Yergason 1931)

The patient is seated or standing with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and forearm pronated The examiner resists active supination and elbow flexion whilst feeling for subluxation of the biceps tendon out of the bicipital groove A positive test indicates subluxation

test 

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

# Yergason’s Test

This test is used for the detection of movement of the tendon out of the groove

# Speed’s Test (Bennett 1998)

The patient’s supinated arm is held at 90 degrees elbow flexion and then flexed forwards against resistance

Pain felt in the bicipital groove indicates biceps tendon pathology

# AC Joint Tests

# Anterior/Posterior AC Shear Test (Davies et al 1981)

With the patient sitting the examiner cups the heels of both hands one over the midpoint of the clavicle anteriorly and one over the spine of the scapula posteriorly With compressive action both hands are squeezed towards each other Several repetitions are applied with note being taken of the amount of movement compared with the opposite shoulder Pain is also considered A positive test is when the patient complains of superiorly located pain unilaterally

# Cross Chest Adduction (Scarf/Forced Adduction Test) (Silliman and Hawkins 1994)

The symptomatic shoulder is flexed to 90 degrees and then forcibly adducted across the chest

# Subacromial Impingement

# Neer Impingement Test (Neer and Welsh 1977)

In this test there is forced elevation of the humerus in the scapula plane whilst the shoulder is internally rotated with the other hand on the top of the shoulder girdle to stabilize A positive test gives rise to pain with passive abduction which indicates impingement within the subacromial space

# Neer Impingement Injection Test (Neer 1983)

The subacromial space is infiltrated with 8–10 mls of local anaesthetic and the above test is repeated If there is greater than 50% reduction in the pain then this indicates that the probable cause of the pain is the bursa or rotator cuff tendon

# Assessment of Injury Risk

# Assessment of Injury Risk

# Hawkin’s-Kennedy Test (Hawkins and Kennedy 1980)

The shoulder is placed in 90 degrees of forward flexion and then passive internal rotation of the humerus is applied by the examiner A positive test is indicated by the provocation of pain around the subacromial space This test indicates internal impingement of the shoulder as the rotator cuff tendons are compressed by the coracoacromial arch

# Empty Can Test (Jobe and Moynes 1982)

Standing in front of the patient to monitor facial expression during the test the patient elevates their arm in the scapular plane to 90 degrees with the arm in full internal rotation so that the thumb is pointing downwards The examiner then exerts downward force and asks the patient to resist A positive test produces pain weakness or both indicating involvement of the supraspinatus tendon

# Full Can Test

This test is carried out similarly to the Empty Can Test except that the thumbs are pointed upwards The test has been shown to isolate the supraspinatus as effectively as the Empty Can Test (Itoi et al 1999)

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

# Rotator Cuff Tear

# Supraspinatus: Drop Arm Test (Hoppenfield and Hutton 1976)

The patient actively abducts the arm in the coronal plane with the thumb pointing forward From the end of abduction the patient is instructed to slowly under control lower the arm If there is lesion within the tendon of Supraspinatus the patient will be unable to control the descent of the arm into adduction from approximately 90 degrees abduction If the patient can hold the arm at 90 degrees abduction then the examiner can lightly apply pressure in downward direction to the hand which – if Supraspinatus lesion is present – will cause the arm to fall into adduction

# Infraspinatus: External Rotation Lag Sign (Hertel et al 1996)

The examiner stands behind the patient with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and elevated to approximately 20 degrees in the plane of the scapula The examiner passively externally rotates the shoulder by holding around the wrist to the onset of capsular tightening whilst supporting the weight of the arm by placing hand under the elbow and asks the patient to actively maintain this position when the examiner lets go of the wrist but maintaining support at the elbow A positive test is recorded if the arm falls back into internal rotation and the magnitude is recorded to the nearest 5 degrees

# Subscapularis: Internal Rotation Lag Sign Test (Hertel et al 1996)

The patient is asked to position his hand behind his back so that the dorsum of the hand is on the lumbar region The examiner passively lifts the hand away from the lumbar region whilst maintaining glenohumeral internal rotation The patient is then asked to voluntarily maintain this position with only elbow support from the examiner A positive result is if the hand falls back towards the spine indicating lesion of the subscapularis The magnitude of the fall back can be recorded to the nearest 5 degrees

# Gerber’s Lift Off Test (Gerber and Krushell 1991)

The dorsum of the patient’s hand is positioned at the level of the midlumbar spine The subject is then asked to lift the dorsum of the hand off the back as far as possible by internally rotating the shoulder The test is considered positive for subscapularis dysfunction if the subject cannot lift the hand off of the back or if the subject performed the lifting maneuver with elbow or shoulder extension The test can be repeated whereby the patient is asked to try and push the examiner’s hand away from the “hand behind back position” A positive test is inability with or without pain

# External Rotation Lag Sign

The patient is seated The elbow is passively flexed to 90 degrees and the shoulder is held at 20 degrees elevation in the scapular plane in position of near maximum external rotation (ie maximum external rotation minus five degrees to avoid elastic recoil) The examiner supports the elbow and holds the arm in external rotation at the wrist The patient is asked to hold the position while the examiner supports the elbow but releases the hold at the wrist The degree of movement is estimated and is referred to as the “lag” (ie the difference between active and passive ROM)

# Internal Rotation Lag Sign

The internal rotation lag sign (Hertel et al 1996) involves the following steps:

- The patient is seated
- The patient is asked to bring the arm behind the back with the palm facing outward
- The arm is held in near maximum internal rotation and with the hand away from the back by approximately 20 degrees of extension
- The patient is asked to hold the position while the examiner supports the elbow but releases the wrist hold

If the patient is unable to hold the position the lag sign is positive

# Special Tests Sensitivities and Specificities

Table 173 gives the sensitivities specificities and likelihood ratios of special tests

# Correlation of Clinical Orthopaedic Tests

Hanchard et al (2004) formulated Table 174 as method of correlating the often confusing results gained from applying battery of clinical orthopaedic tests in order to identify possible pathologies implicated

# Body Inter-relation and Posture

Table 175 shows the intricacies of the and the inter-relation between parts local to the shoulder girdle This can be extrapolated to assess the role of the pelvic girdle position in posture and how leg position can affect the pelvic girdle posture

Although postural alterations have been shown to have some detrimental effects on shoulder girdle function observed postural deviations should be taken in context with the “normal” posture of the patient One way of assessing whether local postural alterations are responsible is to assess the patient in sitting having placed them in an optimal posture and see if positive results from tests are altered; for example correction of forward head posture reduction of

# Rehabilitation

The rehabilitation strategies utilized will depend on the diagnosis made from thorough clinical evaluation The above assesses the whole functional chain and its possible contribution to shoulder pathology The days of diagnosing “rotator cuff tendinitis” are long gone as this is an identification of the site of the pathology but it does nothing to address the cause Certainly if the cause of the pathology is not identified and rectified then the outcome (injury) will return or not resolve completely

Recent research has highlighted that common shoulder pathologies have commonly presenting feature: loss of translational control (Lukasiewicz et al 1999; Ludewig and Cook 2000; Magarey and Jones 2003; Ogston and Ludewig 2007) In addition to this there is an abundance of clinical research which has identified alterations in the dynamic and static positioning of the scapula within cohort of

Individuals with shoulder pathology (Kibler 1998; Ludewig and Cook 2000; Moraes 2008) need to have these factors identified and addressed along with the restoration of neuromuscular control The rehabilitation will require that the individual’s motor skills are trained back to pre-injury levels Dynamic stability of the glenohumeral joint is aided by the sensorimotor system due to the presence of mechanoreceptors within the joint which influence the patterns of muscle recruitment reflex activity and joint stiffness Without correct sensorimotor control there will be increased translation between the humeral head and glenoid resulting in plastic deformation and laxity of the joint capsule decreased rotator cuff facilitation and alterations in muscle sequencing and timing (Ogston and Ludewig 2007)

Ultimately the management of the injured shoulder complex is challenge that can be made easier if based on thorough and exact clinical examination of the whole patient Any approach to the management of the shoulder will be optimally effective in the presence of good clinical reasoning and sound knowledge of the clinical patterns associated with shoulder pathology

# Integrated Scapulothoracic Rehabilitation

Table 176 is very useful tool which can be utilized with any shoulder injury In all cases whether treatment involves surgical intervention or not alterations in faulty posture can be addressed and rehabilitation of other parts of the kinetic chain – trunk and pelvic girdle – can commence at relatively high level Once again consideration of the kinetic chain links and myofascial slings will lead the therapist to areas distal to the shoulder girdle which will require soft tissue work in order to elongate shortened tissues More local tissue work will need to be carried out under the advisement of the surgeon following surgical intervention so that newly repaired tissues are not placed under excessive strain at too early stage

Ranges of movement for the exercises can be modified for the specifics of the patient ensuring that the quality of the movement is correct from the outset and that early substitution patterns are identified and corrected and that movement is fluent and pain-free Once again surgical intervention may require little more lateral thinking in order to carry out specific exercises effectively and safely

When rehabilitating shoulder that has received surgical intervention it is imperative that the therapist converses with the surgeon and understands what technique has been carried out what type of fixation was used what state the repaired tissue was in at the repair and what tissues have been repaired The surgeon and therapist can then formulate patient-specific injury-specific rehabilitation protocol based on information such as at what ranges of movement during the surgery was the repaired tissue put on tension? This information can then be utilized as guide for the protected range of movement during the early stages of rehabilitation

At all times the therapist should bear in mind the histology and phases of healing – inflammatory stage proliferation phase and remodeling phase – and adjust their rehabilitation programme accordingly The below gives some indication of the level of involvement of some of the muscles around the shoulder girdle in common rehabilitation exercises This can be utilized to expedite recovery knowing that some exercises place more or less stress on certain muscles than others

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport - Case Study

# Case Study

A 29-year-old left-handed professional tennis coach presented with complaint of increased left shoulder pain following serving This pain was located over the antero-superior aspect of his glenohumeral joint and increased in intensity with continued overhead activity He stated that he had recently increased the amount of overhead activity during his coaching sessions as he was working to improve some of his pupils’ service action Apart from this he stated that he had not changed anything else concerned with his training He stated that his health was good and that he was not taking any medication and that he had not changed his racquet or string tension recently

Observation was taken from the front back and side of the patient with the patient stripped down to the waist Figure 171 illustrates posture which deviates from the stated “ideal”; the left profile shows forward head posture increased thoracic kyphosis protracted shoulder girdle and anterior humeral head He has an anterior tilted pelvis and sway back posture

Active movements produced left shoulder pain on abduction at 100 degrees (Figure 1719) and flexion at 120 degrees (Figure 1720) which increased as elevation continued and eased at the end of the available active range Abduction demonstrated increased activity in the left upper trapezius Flexion demonstrated increased lumbar extension and anterior pelvic tilt

Active medial rotation on the right was to T7 and left was to T8 (this range was further if scapular winging was allowed to take place) Active lateral rotation utilizing Apply’s Scratch test (subject was instructed to reach over shoulder to “scratch” between scapula and it was noted to which vertebrae the thumb reached) was to T2 on the right and T4 on the left

Resisted tests elicited pain on the empty can and full can tests and on resisted lateral rotation in neutral Hawkins-Kennedy test was negative as were all labral tests but Neer’s test was positive Inner range serratus anterior strength and endurance was deficient when compared to the right and middle and lower trapezius strength was deficient bilaterally

Supine examination (Figures 1721 and 1722) showed that there was an increased distance between the posterior acromion on the left as compared to the right

# Case Study

The right which indicated possible posterior capsular tightness and/or tight pectoralis minor on the left Active medial and lateral rotation (Figures 1723 and 1724) at 90 degrees abduction appeared symmetrical but when repeated with stabilization of the shoulder girdle it was shown that there was restriction of internal rotation of the left which inferred glenohumeral internal rotation deficit that was greater than 10 degrees on the right and the internal rotation deficit did not equal the external rotation gain

Measurement of posterior capsular tightness indicated that the left was tighter than the right and length testing of the pectoralis minor muscles indicated that the left was tighter and responsible for anterior tilt of the scapula

Single leg squat showed poor bilateral pelvic control with medial rotation and adduction of the femurs and corkscrewing at the waist Further lower limb examination showed that there was decreased inner range recruitment of the posterior fibres of gluteus medius on both sides and an over dominance of hamstrings over gluteus maximus on active hip extension

The Thomas test identified tightness of the tensor fascia lata more so on the right than the left and tightness in the iliopsoas muscle bilaterally The Thomas Test position can be used to determine correct function of the iliopsoas muscle group the rectus femoris the tensor fascia latae and the sartorius muscle and assess for their possible involvement in producing alterations in the sagittal pelvis orientation

Rehabilitation focused on lengthening of the posterior capsule utilizing the Sleeper stretch and manually stretching pectoralis minor Facilitation of the lower and middle fibres of trapezius was carried out in prone lying and inner range facilitation of serratus anterior was carried out utilizing manually resisted protraction in supine then progressing to press-up with plus The initial focus was on endurance with repetitions being in the 30–40 repetition range followed by control through range

Postural re-education was commenced facilitating thoracic and lumbar flexion-extension in sitting thoracic spine extension mobilisations were carried out to facilitate reduction of the thoracic kyphosis and increase the recruitment of the middle and lower

# Shoulder Injuries in Sport

Posterior pelvic tilting in crook lying was commenced to facilitate inner range holds of rectus abdominus and gluteus maximus and lengthen the lumbar multifidus and interspinous ligaments Lower limb functional deficits were addressed with inner range gluteus medius holds in side lying and hip extension holds in prone lying In addition to this functional movement patterns were commenced involving multiplanar movements executed with correct lower limb alignment

The athlete ceased overhead activity but was allowed to continue coaching ground strokes until he had full pain-free range of active flexion and abduction Electromyographic feedback and video recording were used to reinforce the correct movement patterns Closed kinetic chain exercises were utilized early on within the rehabilitation programme to facilitate rotator cuff co-activation and postural taping was commenced at the outset to aid with proprioceptive awareness

This athlete complied well with the rehabilitation programme and was able to return to full tennis-related activities within one month with the proviso that he further progress his rehabilitation and include regular stretching exercises and lower limb conditioning as regular part of his training This case demonstrates the multi-factorial nature of shoulder dysfunction The skill of the clinician is to identify relevant clinical findings that require addressing in order to establish long-term recovery

# The Elbow - Chapter Overview

# The Elbow

# Angela Clough

# Senior Lecturer University of Hull

This chapter aims to identify common acute and overuse injuries of the elbow and then discuss the application and principles of systematic assessment of musculoskeletal injuries of the elbow The chapter will further detail acute management strategies of common elbow injuries and principles of rehabilitation through to return to sport The use of appropriate exercises using single or multiple joints as opposed to the conceptually flawed concept of “open” and “closed” kinetic chains will be considered and debated

An “open kinetic chain” exists when the foot or hand is not in contact with the ground or supporting surface In “closed kinetic chain” the foot or hand is weight-bearing and is therefore in contact with the ground or supporting surface

To further illustrate the management of these musculoskeletal injuries of the elbow case study will be used to highlight key assessment treatment and rehabilitation strategies This chapter draws together and analyses common approaches to treatment within an evidence-based framework

# Common Elbow Injuries/Conditions

To fully appreciate the scope of injuries and pathologies common to the elbow joint one needs to consider how the elbow functions in relation to upper limb kinematics This chapter will focus on the injuries listed in Table 181 and will further provide guidelines on injury management techniques for range of acute and overuse injuries to both the elbow and forearm A systematic analysis will be detailed through assessment and treatment of these injuries which then informs the nature of the rehabilitation

# Principles of Assessment

Assessment relies on good applied knowledge of anatomy; systematic and applied approach to the assessment process It is important when assessing client to understand the functionality of the joint so that comparisons of dysfunction can be made Good clinical assessment skills such as the ability to listen to the client and record the appropriate assessment findings will further enhance both the assessment and subsequent treatment of the client

Assessment and treatment are often complex procedures that draw on multitude of information processing techniques Figure 181 provides an overview of the problem-solving conceptual model in relation to clinical management It would be useful to refer to the chapter on clinical reasoning (Chapter 16) to better assist in understanding the process of clinical thinking and action

# Key Principles of Subjective History Taking

The key aspects of assessing an elbow are: “active listening” ensuring we take logical subjective history

# History Taking

It is important to gather comprehensive history of the onset of the problem to guide the assessment Prompts may include:

- What brings you to see me today?
- What do you think I can do to help you?
- When did it happen?

Can the client recall how it happened? Did they “fall on an outstretched hand” commonly abbreviated to FOOSH? This approach is constructive for taking history and includes reflective practice approach to clearly identify needs (Cole 2005) The goal of reflective practice is to help practitioners continually improve their practice by identifying strengths and areas needing improvement (Cross 2004; Hilliard 2006)

It is crucial to establish “informed consent” for both examination and treatment Some questioning may be misinterpreted as “personal” so all aspects of the assessment need to be clearly explained The client should be given the opportunity to ask questions to clarify anything they do not understand Flory and Emanuel (2004) completed systematic review on informed consent comprehension and found that enhanced consent forms had limited success They recommended having team member spend time with the client to ensure understanding

# Key Principles of Subjective History Taking

# Key Principles of Subjective History Taking

# Applied Anatomical Knowledge

# 3 Key Impacting Factors

- Informed consent
- Contra-indications
- Record keeping

# 3 L’s

- Look
- Listen
- Learn

# 3 R’s

- Reflect
- Review
- Re-evaluate

# Logical Approach

Systematic ‘basic’ assessment that can be built upon:
- “Active listening”
- Learn be prepared to be open-minded

# Reflection and Review

Reflect upon past experience Base review upon key subjective for objective markers and ideally functional client-focused marker As therapist feel comfortable with the review process be prepared to be wrong and move on based on sound findings to more effective way forward

- “First do no harm”
- Be safe be effective
- Be eclectic in approach
- Be evidence-based

Talking on one-to-one basis seemed to be the best way of improving understanding Lidz Applebaum and Meisel (1988) discussed two different ways in which informed consent can be implemented The “event” model treats informed consent as procedure to be performed once in each treatment course which must cover all legal elements at that time The “process” model in contrast tries to integrate informing the patient into the continuing dialogue between clinician and client that is routine part of both diagnosis and treatment and has more benefits as model to work on

If they cannot recall an injury was there change in their training pattern? Had they undertaken any repetitive DIY type activities? Alternatively was there prolonged pressure applied? How would they describe their symptoms? Did they occur straight away? Has the behaviour of the symptoms changed? Since the onset of symptoms are they “the same” “better” or worse? This gives the clinician guide as to the type of problem Is it an acute trauma or an overuse/overload problem? Is it pressure/impingement problem?

From the behaviour and pattern of the symptoms the clinician can get an idea of the stage of healing as well as working knowledge of “referred pain” from for example the cervical and thoracic spine an applied knowledge of peripheral nerve pathways and muscles supplied by them and therefore affected by potential injury

It is important to have knowledge of dermatomes (areas of skin supplied by peripheral nerves) an awareness of variations in dermatomes and also anomalies in dermatomes which link to wider and more consolidated knowledge of referred pain

It is essential to have an awareness of the variations of “normal” in terms of range of movement (ROM) Is it within the normal limits or is it hyper-mobile/excessive motion? Is it stiff/limited in some way and if so is that due to pain apprehension swelling or protective spasm? Application of these principles will facilitate differential diagnosis

# Observation

Ideally general observation is made of the client without the patient being aware for example as they enter the reception area The three key points to observe are: face posture and gait The face may indicate pain or lack of sleep In terms of posture there is an increased “carrying angle” in females (to clear the hips) than in males The client may be protectively “guarding” their elbow they may be hypermobile or have reduced arm swing

# Inspection

This should be completed with the client appropriately undressed so that the affected areas may be observed in good light The focus should be on:

1 Observing any asymmetries or abnormalities in the affected area

2 Noting any signs of swelling discoloration or deformity

3 Assessing the range of motion and any limitations present

# The Elbow

The elbow is complex joint that plays crucial role in the movement of the arm It consists of three bones: the humerus the radius and the ulna The elbow allows for flexion and extension of the forearm as well as rotation of the forearm

Understanding the dermatomes associated with the elbow is essential for diagnosing and treating conditions related to this joint The dermatomes are areas of skin that are mainly supplied by single spinal nerve root The diagram above illustrates the dermatomes relevant to the elbow region

# Key Points

- The elbow joint is formed by the humerus radius and ulna
- It allows for flexion extension and rotation of the forearm
- Dermatomes are important for understanding sensory innervation in the elbow area

# Key Principles of Objective Examination

# Key Principles of Objective Examination

The inspection would be completed after thorough subjective history has been taken and reflected on so that clinically reasoned approach may be taken as to what to test objectively and why it is being tested Clinicians may add in additional tests but it is essential to have clear basic examination that is both logical and systematic The approach taken by the Society of Orthopaedic Medicine (SOM) which is based on the work of the late Dr James Cyriax is good basic assessment approach Additional tests can be added in as relevant to enhance clinical reasoning

If there has been fall there may well be an obvious visible distortion of the bones/joint following an injury which may indicate either fracture or dislocation Likewise there may be bruising evident or redness indicating inflammation It is unusual to see muscle wasting in an acute injury as it often relates either to disuse or develops with more chronic condition Muscle wasting may also be an indication of neurological involvement possibly due to reflex muscle inhibition associated with an effusion at the joint The presence of swelling is indicative of inflammation from either overuse or trauma

# Palpation for Heat Swelling and Synovial Thickening

It is essential to establish “signs of activity” at this stage indicating the presence of inflammation using the back of the hand and comparing the symptom-free side to the symptomatic side Synovial thickening has distinctive “boggy” feel and is relatively common in rheumatoid arthritis particularly at the wrist knee and ankle

# Establish State at Rest

The symptoms at rest must be clarified prior to any objective testing requiring movement of joints and muscles A baseline is established by asking an open question avoiding the use of the word “pain” to avoid leading the patient An example may be “How are you feeling now?” Once this has been established it makes comparison of the state at rest with any potential change of symptoms on movement easier to clinically reason It is helpful to use terms such as: same better or worse It may also be useful to utilize 10-point Likert scale where the patient can draw line with “0” being symptom-free and “10” being the worst symptoms they can imagine A constructive suggestion may be to use printed “smiley” face above the “0” on the scale and “sad” face above the “10” on the scale which has visual impact and helps

# Table 1: Applying Selective Tension

|Active|Passive|Resisted|
|---|---|---|
|Active movements assess the range of movement the pain experienced by the client strength in the client’s muscle groups and it shows the willingness of the client to move and quality of that movement The elbow is not an “emotional” joint ie the reported signs and symptoms are normally specific and can be localized easily by the client Unlike the cervical spine or shoulder that may have more complex subjective history Normal active movement of the elbow joint is: - Elbow flexion: 0–150 degrees
- Elbow extension: 0–10 degrees of hyperextension
|Passive movements test the inert structures eg joint capsules and ligaments Passive movements test pain range and “end-feel” There are three normal “end-feels” to passive movement testing: - Hard (bone to bone as in end of range elbow extension)
- Soft (approximation of soft tissue as in end of range elbow flexion)
- Elastic (it is the “elastic” resistance felt at end of range as in full elevation of the shoulder)
|Resisted movement tests are used in order to test the contractile structures eg muscle tendon This is the minimum that would be appropriate depending on the experience and the clinical reasoning of the clinician|

# Possible Responses to Resisted Muscle Testing

- Normal response: strong and pain-free
- Contractile lesion: strong and painful
- Neurological weakness: weak but pain-free
- Partial rupture (or suspected more serious pathology eg fracture or tumour): weak and painful
- Claudication/provocation of an overuse injury: painful on repetition
- Psychological component/serious pathology: “juddering”/exaggerated response

The client should focus on giving accurate feedback to the rehabilitator More importantly it is movement within the control of the client at an early stage of the assessment procedure

# Examination by Application of Selective Tension

James Cyriax developed systematic approach to objective assessment which is termed “applying selective tension” (Cyriax 1982; Cyriax and Cyriax 1983; Kesson and Atkins 2005) This means to apply active passive and resisted movements appropriately Table 13 may clarify the application of selective tension

With the latter response the clinician must heed the warning “beware the bizarre but consistent patient”! Some clinicians will always start with active range of motion as it provides guide to client’s “willingness” to move the quality of movement

# Table 13: Society of Orthopaedic Medicine’s Suggested Order of Selective Tension Tests for the Elbow

|Passive|Resisted|
|---|---|
|- Elbow flexion (normally “soft” end-feel)
- Elbow extension (normally “hard” end-feel)
- Pronation of the superior radioulnar joint (normally an “elastic” end-feel)
- Supination of the superior radioulnar joint (normally an “elastic” end-feel)
|- Elbow flexion
- Elbow extension
- Pronation
- Supination

# Elbow and Radioulnar Joints

# Provocative Tests for Epicondylitis

These are:

- Resisted wrist extension for tennis elbow
- Resisted wrist flexion for golfer's elbow

An additional test to be aware of if one suspects peripheral nerve involvement is Tinel’s test A positive response reproduces the client’s symptoms over the involved nerve sensory distribution For the ulnar nerve gently tap along the area where it is most superficial where it travels along the groove between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle

Novak et al (1994) investigated provocative testing for cubital tunnel syndrome and found that this test had 070 sensitivity and 098 specificity They had sample of 32 patients with cubital tunnel syndrome (mean age 46 age range 24–81) Those with previous history of nerve symptoms were excluded In the test group 31 of the 32 had positive Tinel’s sign The tester performed 4–6 taps over the ulnar nerve just proximal to the cubital tunnel Significant differences ( < 00001) between the group with cubital tunnel syndrome and the control group were found for all positive tests In summary this test accurately identifies the likelihood of cubital tunnel syndrome given positive test

Within 30 seconds the highest sensitivity specificity and positive predictive value were found in the combined test Within 60 seconds only the sensitivity for the pressure provocation and elbow flexion test increased to 098 in those subjects with cubital tunnel syndrome The combined pressure and flexion test was performed by placing the subject’s elbow in maximum flexion and whilst in this position pressure was placed on the ulnar nerve just proximal to the cubital tunnel Subject symptom response was recorded at both 30 and 60 seconds The clinical provocative evaluation techniques have been extrapolated to the cubital tunnel syndrome although statistical verification of these tests is lacking (Buehler and Thayer 1988; Rayan 1992; Rayan Jenson and Duke 1992)

The test has been adapted to gently tap over the mid-point of the flexor retinaculum at the wrist which may reproduce tingling over the median nerve distribution consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome If these tests are positive the client may be referred for nerve conduction study tests prior to consideration of surgical decompression of the affected nerve

Figure 1 Palpation of the elbow

# Palpation to Confirm the Lesion Site

This is assuming there is nothing in the subjective history to suggest referred pain from the cervical spine For example altered sensation “tingling” numbness and reduced or absent reflexes The rehabilitator would then palpate for the exact site of the lesion

# Acute Elbow Injuries

# Muscle Lesions

Minor muscle tears commonly occur in muscle bellies around the elbow Muscles likely to be involved include the extensor group presenting as tennis elbow on the lateral aspect The pronator teres muscle may be tender 2–3 cm distal to the medial epicondyle as variation of the flexor group presenting as golfer's elbow

Assessment of involvement is by application of selective tissue tension Pain is reported on resisted muscle contraction and involvement is confirmed by palpation There is good response to local transverse friction massage If it is the muscle belly the client is positioned with the muscle supported comfortably with the muscle in shortened position The transverse friction massage is performed at 90 degrees to the alignment of the muscle fibers The application of gentle transverse friction massage

# Applied Techniques in the Initial Inflammatory Phase

Applied techniques in the initial inflammatory phase may increase the rate of phagocytosis (Evans 1980) It is useful to apply the technique in the first days following injury provided the grade is appropriate for the stage of healing and the irritability of the tissue This approach avoids disruption to healing and increased bleeding (Kesson and Atkins 2005) Normally this would decrease pain and increase the range of movement The increase in range should be followed up with exercise in the pain-free range of movement

# Tendon Ruptures

Acute avulsions of triceps or biceps are rare The triceps tendon tends to be affected more commonly with excessive deceleration force as in fall The biceps tendon is more associated with weight lifting activities Acute ruptures of either require surgical repair

# Pulled Elbow

This occurs quite frequently in children under 5 years old often accompanied by guilty and upset parent The most common mechanism is when parent snatches the hand of child misbehaving at the edge of pavement or when parents “swing” their child in play between them Activities such as pitching in baseball serving in tennis spiking in volleyball passing in American football and launching in javelin throwing can all produce elbow pathology by forceful valgus stress usually during high-velocity eccentric loading during the terminal deceleration of the limb This results in medial stretching lateral compression and posterior impingement

With the exception of baseball there are few prospective cohort studies on the epidemiological trends of childhood elbow injuries in other sports Delineating injury patterns to the elbow in children can be challenging given the cartilaginous composition of the distal humerus and the multiple secondary ossification centers that appear and unite with the epiphysis at defined ages (Magra et al 2007)

The joint at such young age is lax and prone to recurrent injury if the annular ligament is subjected to repeated overstretching (Illingworth 1975) The radial head easily slides from beneath the orbicular ligament causing immediate pain and noticeable limit of supination There is normally spontaneous recovery if the arm is rested in sling for 48 hours It may be reduced by forced supination while pushing the radius in proximal direction or by forced radial deviation of the hand (McRae 2003; Kesson and Atkins 2005)

In children and adolescents the epiphyseal plate is weaker than the surrounding ligaments predisposing them to epiphyseal plate injuries Conversely post-pubescent or skeletally mature athletes are more prone to tendinous or ligamentous injury Such injuries may cause significant impact on the athlete parents and the healthcare system (Magra 2007)

# Fractures/Dislocations

It is essential that fractures of the elbow region are diagnosed early and managed appropriately as the complication rate is higher than with fractures close to other joints Unstable or displaced fractures should be promptly referred for surgical orthopedic intervention However when the articular or cortical surface has less than 2mm of vertical or horizontal displacement the fracture may be regarded as stable and treated conservatively (Shapiro and Wang 1995)

Over-vigorous rehabilitation can be an issue with the elbow Remember safety of the client is paramount: “first do no harm!” A clear understanding of the applied anatomy and appropriate application of graded rehabilitation should result in no problems Awareness and caution are essential in the musculoskeletal management of the elbow It is therefore essential that the clinician is aware of myositis ossificans condition that may occur after supracondylar fractures and dislocations of the elbow

# Myositis Ossificans/Heterotopic Ossification

Myositis ossificans is calcification that occurs within the hematoma that forms in the brachialis muscle covering the anterior aspect of the elbow joint It is often attributed to inappropriate vigorous exercise after supracondylar fracture or dislocation of the elbow Gentle active grade A exercise should always be within the pain-free range of available movement The ideal situation is to prevent it from happening by avoiding over-vigorous exercise

If it occurs it presents as mechanical block to flexion with an abnormal “hard” end feel where the normal end feel to end of range flexion should be “soft” If discovered at an early stage and the joint is given complete rest this minimizes the mass of calcified tissue

# Acute Elbow Injuries

# Myositis Ossificans and Heterotopic Ossification

Myositis ossificans is condition characterized by the formation of bone tissue in muscles often following trauma Heterotopic ossification refers to the formation of trabecular bone outside the skeleton and is sign of myositis ossificans According to Kumar et al (2009) myositis ossificans is distinguished from other fibroblastic proliferations by the presence of metaplastic bone It typically develops in athletic adolescents and young adults often following trauma in more than 50% of cases

The lesion usually arises in the musculature of the proximal extremities Clinical findings vary with the stage of development: in the early phase the area is swollen and painful becoming more circumscribed and firm over several weeks and eventually evolving into painless hard well-demarcated mass

# Posterior Dislocation

Posterior dislocation is one of the most serious acute injuries to the elbow often associated with fracture of the coronoid process or radial head The most common mechanism of injury is in contact sports A major complication is the impairment of vascular supply to the forearm making the assessment of pulses distal to the dislocation essential

Urgent reduction is required if pulses are absent Reduction is typically straightforward if performed quickly before protective muscle spasm sets in The elbow is held at 45 degrees of flexion and the clinician applies longitudinal traction with firm grip on the anterior aspect of the humerus often resulting in an audible "clunk" upon reduction

If post-reduction vascular impairment persists surgical intervention is urgently required A post-reduction X-ray is advised along with an assessment of the stability of the collateral ligaments Undisplaced fractures of the radial head or small fractures of the coronoid process generally require conservative treatment in supportive sling for 2–3 weeks

A common complication following elbow dislocation is loss of extension Ross et al (1999) found that immediate active grade A mobilization (in the pain-free range of movement) results in less restriction of elbow extension with an increase in instability of the elbow joint Rehabilitation should be approached with care to avoid myositis ossificans/heterotopic ossification due to over-vigorous exercise

# Supracondylar Fractures

Supracondylar fractures are more common in children than adults typically resulting from fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) These fractures are considered an orthopedic emergency due to their high rate of neurovascular complications and rotational instability Initial management involves closed reduction with pins followed by splinting Pins are usually removed after 4–6 weeks and recovery in children is generally uncomplicated

In older populations Robinson et al (2003) reported an incidence of distal humeral fractures in adults at 57 cases per 100000 per year with nearly equal male to female ratio The majority of fractures were extra-articular (AO/OTA type A) or complete articular fractures (AO/OTA type C) Most patients experienced low complication rates during treatment with 906% of fractures uniting within 12 weeks

The risk of union complications was higher following high-energy injuries open fractures and non-operative treatment Although the AO/OTA classification was not predictive of union complications certain fracture configurations (low transcondylar and simple intercondylar) had greater risk of complications Infection myositis ossificans and other implant-related complications were more common following operative treatment of type C fractures compared to types A and B

# The Elbow - Physiotherapy Knowledge

# The Elbow

# Fractures

Fractures are defined in this study The majority of these fractures are best treated surgically by rigid open reduction and internal fixation except for low Type A and C fractures which have higher risk of union complications The role of total elbow arthroplasty to treat these more complex injuries requires further evaluation

# Radial Head Fracture

This is the most common fracture around the elbow They are classified into types 1–4 and the mechanism is normally from fall on an outstretched hand

- Type 1: Non or minimally displaced They respond to early aspiration splinting (removable) active grade “A” (pain-free) mobilisation and normally heal in 6–8 weeks
- Type 2: Displaced fractures that respond to surgical intervention
- Type 3: Managed by surgical excision
- Type 4: Fractures in the presence of dislocation that always require surgical treatment as they can be very unstable

An isolated fracture of the ulna may be treated conservatively by the use of an above elbow cast in mid-pronation for 8 weeks In children angulations of less than 10 degrees are considered acceptable The favoured position for immobilisation is in pronation although in proximal radial fractures and also in Smith’s fractures at the wrist the forearm should extend above the elbow and leave the metacarpophalangeal joints free

# Stress Fracture

Stress fractures are result of overload overtraining or insufficient rest Brukner et al (1999) studied sportspeople (baseball tennis and swimming) sustaining this type of fracture; they found that the key element of musculoskeletal management was rest primarily It must also include correction of any predisposing factors and multi-disciplinary approach to the correction of any faulty technique

# Olecranon Fractures

The mechanism is normally from fall on an outstretched hand If it is stable the client should be able to extend the arm and lift it against gravity Management would be 2–3 weeks in splint then active grade “A” (pain-free ROM) mobilisation If it is unstable open-reduction with internal fixation is required In this instance active mobilisation can start within week of surgery

# Fracture of the Radius and Ulna

The mechanism of injury to the forearm bones is fall on an outstretched hand It is usually clinically obvious X-rays should be taken for post-reduction comparison

Two types of dislocation occur:

- Monteggia Injury: A fractured ulna with dislocated head of the radius at the elbow joint
- Galeazzi Injury: A fractured radius with dislocated head of the ulna at the wrist joint

In adults perfect reduction by an orthopaedic surgeon for internal fixation of the radial and ulnar fracture is required in order to return to sport Depending on the accuracy of reduction either cast or support is required post-operatively for 8–10 weeks Monteggia and Galeazzi injuries are often displaced

# Overuse Injuries to Elbow and Forearm

# Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis / Extensor Tendinopathy)

Tennis elbow is traditional term It is common condition arising in the sporting context from overload in racquet sports Overload in occupational and domestic settings that include repeated grasping movements particularly middle-aged DIY enthusiasts (Hutson 1990) It is frequently reported condition which is characterised by pain over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and aggravation of the pain on resisted dorsiflexion of the wrist (Verhaar 1994)

The incidence in general practice surgeries is about 4–7 per 1000 patients per year (Kivi 1983) There is an annual incidence of 1–3% in the general population (Allander 1974; Chard and Hazelman 1989; Verhaar 1994) If left untreated the complaint is estimated to last from 6 months to 2 years (Cyriax 1936; Bailey 1957; Binder et al 1985; Hudak et al 1996)

Historically it has been difficult condition to manage with wide range of procedures and management protocols advocated (Reid and Kushner 1993; Noteboom et al 1994; Caldwell and Safran 1995; Putham and Cohen 1999; Jones and Rivett 2005)

# Overuse Injuries to Elbow and Forearm

In general management is prolonged and long-term outcomes questionable When it is clinically indicated the mobilization with movement (MWM) for tennis elbow as described by Mulligan (1999) is simple but effective means of treating this condition However an indication for use is determined by trial application of the technique The reasons for selection of MWM for treatment were:

- Immediate abolishment of pain during the trial/testing
- Previous experience and knowledge of efficacy of the technique
- Potential for integration into home management programme

(Mulligan 1999)

Struijs et al (2001) conducted systematic review of orthotic devices for tennis elbow This study was done in Amsterdam as 21% of clients with lateral epicondylitis were prescribed an orthotic device as treatment strategy (Verhaar 1992) They concluded that no definitive conclusions could be drawn concerning the effectiveness of orthotic devices for lateral epicondylitis They reported that no functional outcome measures such as the Pain Free Function Questionnaire were reported (Stratford et al 1987) They recommended set of valid and reliable outcome measures be included in management and also the cost-effectiveness of relatively inexpensive orthotic device as treatment strategy or as an addition to any other conventional treatment since the use of orthotic devices may reduce costs of sick leave by reduction of the pain experienced during activities Better designed and well-conducted RCTs of sufficient power are warranted

The pathological process is degeneration of the ECRB tendon at the extensor origin of the lateral epicondyle The mechanism of injury is multi-factorial The key contributing factors being: “overuse”; heavy racquet or too small grip; recent change of racquet or too tight grip between shots; muscle imbalance and loss of flexibility; poor blood supply of the 1–2 cm of the distal attachment of ECRB; and repeated excessive loading leading to degenerative changes in the tendon If there is continued use there will be microscopic tearing and scarring within the tendon (Regan et al 1992) This is mechanical process primarily and as such it should be described as tendonosis (Nirshel 1992) or tendinopathy rather than tendonitis Histologically there is an invasion of fibroblasts and vascular granulation tissue which is known as angiofibroplastic hyperplasia (Brukner and Khan 2002)

With any overuse injury “relative rest” is required; that is maintain active full range of motion but limit the “aggravating” activity

In view of the pathology the treatment of lateral epicondylitis with corticosteroid injection is controversial (Labelle et al 1992; Cameron 1995; Assendelft et al 1996; Hay et al 1999) It is accepted that in most cases this is degenerative rather than inflammatory However with correction of predisposing factors and appropriate staged rehabilitation injection is rarely required

In randomised controlled trial in Australia (Bisset et al 2006) researchers found physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and active exercise had superior benefit in the first 6 weeks to corticosteroid injections after 6 weeks providing reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term The significant short-term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after 6 weeks with high recurrence rates implying that this treatment should be used with caution in tennis elbow

# Other Common Injuries

This covers the following injuries: posterior impingement syndromes thrower’s elbow stress fracture of olecranon entrapment of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) and radial tunnel syndrome

# The Elbow - Physiotherapy Knowledge

symptoms 

# The Elbow

# Posterior Impingement of the Olecranon

Posterior impingement of the olecranon fossa valgus stress to the medial structures of the elbow joint and compression injuries to the radiohumeral joint are all linked to repeated high-velocity throwing for example shot putting (Figure 1813)

# Common Conditions Associated with Throwing

Often with throwing there is forced hyperextension at the elbow which produces shearing force between the olecranon and olecranon fossa hence the blanket term “throwers elbow” which may give rise to elbow problems (Hutson 1990) Initially there is soft tissue hypertrophy but if it is not addressed then osteophytes can on the tip of the olecranon and within the fossa particularly in the supracondylar ridge area

# Prevention and Management

From prevention perspective it is essential that the athlete’s training technique is observed and their training schedule is discussed with both the athlete and coach in order to deploy the appropriate problem-solving approach to the management of this closely related range of conditions which all have similar reported signs and symptoms It may be that osteophytes appear due to overuse or there may be stress fracture caused by the athlete having poor eccentric strength of the antagonistic muscle group This would result in an inability to effectively decelerate once the object is released; therefore eccentric training of the antagonistic muscles is essential The rehabilitator should keep an open mind review and monitor intervention in order to clinically problem-solve and utilize the most effective strategy for musculoskeletal management

# Differentiating Conditions

It is often difficult to differentiate between extensor tendinopathy and early stages of PIN (Posterior Interosseous Nerve) entrapment The latter is seen in patients who repetitively pronate and supinate the forearm as opposed to extensor tendinopathy which is more frequently associated with repeated wrist extension If this is taken into account in the subjective history taking it makes it easier to clinically reason the appropriate differential test to localize the target tissue

# Signs and Symptoms of PIN Entrapment

As with any peripheral nerve involvement one would expect pain and paresthesia Signs and symptoms that would indicate PIN entrapment may include:

Pain over the forearm extensor muscle group
Paresthesia of the hand and lateral aspect of the forearm
Aching of the wrist
Pain in the middle and/or upper third of the humerus
Maximum tenderness reported over the supinator muscle (four fingers breadth distal to the lateral epicondyle) This differentiates it from extensor tendinopathy as the most common site is at the teno-osseous site
Resisted supination of the forearm with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the forearm fully pronated
Pain reproduced with resisted extension of the middle finger with the elbow in full extension However this may be positive test in extensor tendinopathy as well

# Overuse Injuries to Elbow and Forearm

# Overuse Injuries to Elbow and Forearm

# Neural Tension Tests

Applying neural tension tests may also be included as they may reproduce the patients’ symptoms (The reader is directed to the works of Butler et al 2000 and Shacklock 2005)

# Management for Extensor Tendinopathy

Management for extensor tendinopathy would include graded transverse friction massage (applied at 90 degrees to the target tissue) Appropriate neurodynamic mobilisation techniques may be added This is normally successful; however decompression may be required in stubborn resistant cases and this has good success rate (Lutz 1991) The key here is good differential diagnosis and early appropriate intervention as tendinopathy responds well to rehabilitation

However if posterior impingement is not diagnosed early it is common for athletes to have fixed flexion deformity and report pain at end-of-range extension It is difficult to treat conservatively at that stage and requires arthroscopic surgery in order to remove the impinging bone It often takes up to 3 months on average to return to throwing sports Hay and Bell (1998) found that in series of 100 elbow arthroscopies 93% reported satisfactory improvement in pain with an average of nine degrees improvement in extension

# Olecranon Bursitis

Swelling of the olecranon bursa commonly occurs after repetitive trauma in clients who repeatedly traumatise the posterior aspect of the elbow for example carpet fitters It may occur after single traumatic episode following fall onto the elbow or indeed to those who rest their elbow on hard surface common posture in students hence the colloquial term “student’s elbow” Any sport that involves either prolonged pressure on the elbow or potential trauma directly to the elbow The most common sport referencing olecranon bursitis is ice hockey Also shooters/marksmen that lie prone to accurately aim their shot are prone to olecranon bursitis from sustained pressure on the bursa

There is often visible swelling reduced range of movement and pain on palpation of the bursa (Loudon et al 2008) It is subcutaneous bursa and may become filled with blood and serous fluid

The condition is usually painless unless there is an associated bacterial infection This is serious complication and requires prompt drainage strict rest and antibiotic therapy to prevent the onset of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis Surgical excision is occasionally performed for cosmetic reasons

# Radio-humeral Bursitis

Radio-humeral bursitis is seen very occasionally in athletes It may be differentiated from extensor tendinopathy by the site of the tenderness which is anterior and distal to the lateral epicondyle There is maximum tenderness over the anterolateral aspect of the head of the radius It may be confirmed by using diagnostic ultrasound techniques Clinically on presentation there is “muddle” of signs on assessment The most effective treatment is corticosteroid treatment

# Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Capitellum

Osteochondritis dissecans is often seen in gymnasts and may respond well to rest in the early stages if it is diagnosed quickly However it is localized area of avascular necrosis on the anterolateral aspect of the capitellum The articular surface of the bone softens and may progress to subchondral collapse and even loose bodies forming in the elbow It is significant condition as it may cause an enlarged and deformed capitellum

In paper on arthroscopic classification and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum Baumgarten Andres and Satterwhite (1996) investigated patients (n = 17) that underwent abrasion chondroplasty of the lesion and removal of any loose bodies and osteophytes The average follow-up was 48 months

# Arthroscopic Classification System (1998)

Three patients gave up sport but all the others returned to preoperative sport The authors proposed an arthroscopic classification system including treatment recommendations:

- Grade 1: Symptomatic cases should undergo drilling
- Grade 2: Lesions not responding to non-operative treatment should undergo removal of all affected cartilage back to stable rim followed by abrasion chondroplasty of the underlying bone
- Grade 3 and 4: Lesions should have the osteochondral fragment removed
- Grade 5: Lesions should undergo abrasion chondroplasty of the exposed crater including diligent search for loose bodies in the elbow joint which should be removed Any associated osteophyte or synovitis in other elbow compartments should also be removed An early active range of motion and strengthening program should begin as soon as possible post-operatively

Even though the authors advocate for arthroscopic treatment they emphasize that it is technically difficult procedure and should only be attempted by surgeons with high level of experience in elbow arthroplasty If the lesion cannot be visualized or treated easily by arthroscopic means formal open arthrotomy is recommended to avoid damage to the surrounding normal joint space

# Panner's Disease

Panner’s disease is self-limiting condition that presents in children under the age of 11 predominantly affecting males (90% male dominance Loudon et al 2008) It is characterized by fragmentation of the entire ossific center of the capitellum bone There are no loose bodies and surgery is not required (Brukner and Khan 2002) It is essential to ensure that growing children have adequate rest between training sessions With proper pacing of activity and correct coaching techniques most overuse injuries in young athletes are preventable

Panner's disease is often atraumatic and presents with swelling local tenderness "clicking" and decrease in elbow extension motion It responds well to relative rest and gentle grade "A" exercises in the pain-free range of motion

# Golfer's Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis / Flexor / Pronator Tendinopathy)

Golfer's elbow is less common than lateral epicondylitis and has many alternative names including racquetball elbow swimmer’s elbow and Little League elbow It is an enthesopathy of the common flexor origin at the medial epicondyle Assessment reveals localized tenderness at or below the medial epicondyle with pain reported on resisted wrist flexion and forearm pronation primarily affecting the pronator teres

This condition results from repetitive microtrauma to the flexor muscle group mainly the flexor carpi radialis during repeated wrist pronation and flexion (Prentice 2004) Management should follow the same principles as tennis elbow including:

- Graded transverse friction massage to the teno-osseous site or musculotendinous junction
- Corticosteroid injection of triamcinolone acetonide with local anesthetic to the teno-osseous site followed by 10 days of relative rest
- Supplementation with neural stretching

Addressing overuse issues in sports is essential for management Activity should be appropriately paced in terms of frequency duration and intensity The initial step in management is to alter any faulty performance mechanics to minimize repetitive stress Plancher and Lucas (2001) noted that stressful components can be alleviated by adjusting the frequency intensity or duration of play One common error in management is progressing too quickly in the exercise program and hastily returning to sport without proper monitoring Involved muscles must regain appropriate strength flexibility and endurance while reducing inflammation and pain Ideally in an overuse injury active movements should be pain-free before progressing to resisted exercises

# Overuse Injuries to Elbow and Forearm

A good coach should be aware of preventable overuse injuries like golfer’s elbow by ensuring that training is appropriately structured and that they work with the therapist and the client as team The range of movement should be maintained in the pain-free range of motion with relative rest from any pain–provoking activities

This may occur as either an overuse injury normally associated with excessive valgus stress due to repeated throwing activities for example javelin and discus throwers The common mechanism is throwers who “open up too early”; that is they become front on at too early stage in the throwing action This results in inflammation of the ligament which progresses to scarring then calcification and very occasionally to ligament rupture

On assessment there is often mild degree of instability on valgus stress test The client reports localized tenderness over the ligament on palpation There are often associated abnormalities such as flexion contracture over the forearm muscles synovitis and also loose formation around the tip of the olecranon

In America “Little Leaguer’s elbow” (common in baseball pitchers) is the descriptive for the adolescent complaining of recurrent pain on the medial side of the elbow joint Repetitive trauma may cause traction avulsion of the medial epicondyle (Slocum 1978) Plancher et al (2001) and Mehta and Bain (2004) noted that an MCL avulsion represents 10–30% of all injuries to the elbow

Management in the early stages involves correction of any faulty technique and therefore reduction of biomechanical stress grade A exercise (active passive or resisted in the pain-free range of movement) graded transverse friction massage (TFM) applied at 90 degrees to the target tissues initially with 6 deep sweeps after analgesia progressing to 10 minutes of TFM after analgesia Specific muscle strengthening should be started by focusing on the forearm flexors and pronators Alternatively an injection of small dose of corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide mixed with local anaesthetic following principles mentioned earlier followed by 10 days of relative rest then graded rehabilitation

Advanced pathology may need arthroscopic removal of any loose bodies and bony spurs Sometimes if timely staged rehabilitation is not available significant instability may develop which requires ligament reconstruction Ideally this is preventable situation and reconstruction is to be avoided as results have been disappointing

# Ulnar Nerve Compression

The ulnar nerve may be compressed at the elbow Posterior to the medial epicondyle it is very superficial and is therefore at risk from direct trauma It may also be compressed by the formation of osteophytes This presents with numbness in the ulnar one and half fingers and dorsal aspect of the ulnar border of the hand It may respond to neurodynamic principles but often decompressive surgery gives the best results particularly if it has progressed to motor weakness of the thumb adductor interossei and hypothenar muscles The nerve may be compromised at the wrist in the canal of Guyon This is common in cyclists and is often termed “handlebar neuropathy” at the wrist where there may be repeated pressure on the handlebars

# Muscle Lesions

Minor muscle tears commonly occur in muscle bellies around the elbow Acute lesions have been dealt with earlier In “overtraining/overuse” situations muscles may be subjected to delayed onset muscle soreness commonly referred to as DOMS

# Theories Relating to DOMS

- 1 Eccentric or Isometric Contractions: DOMS seems to be more likely with eccentric or isometric contractions A primary component of DOMS is thought to be an inflammatory reaction in the tissues leading to minor connective tissue damage (Leiber and Friden 1999; Vickers 2001) Damage caused by eccentric exercise is thought to be mechanical damage to either the muscle or the connective tissue Accumulation of edema and delay in the rate of glycogen replenishment are secondary reactions to mechanical damage (O’Reilly et al 1987)
- 2 Damage to Connective Tissue: DOMS may be caused by damage to the elastic components of connective tissue at the musculotendinous junction This damage results in the presence of hydroxyproline protein by-product of collagen breakdown in blood

# The Elbow - Physiotherapy Knowledge

# The Elbow

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) can be influenced by various factors including muscle fiber damage which results in elevated blood serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) (Smith et al 1994) This indicates that muscle fiber damage is often consequence of strenuous exercise (Evans 1987)

# Prevention and Treatment of DOMS

DOMS can best be prevented by grading activity Athletes should be advised to start at moderate level of activity and gradually increase the intensity of exercise over time Prevention is preferred; however DOMS responds well to local massage techniques Anecdotal evidence suggests that massage or therapeutic touch can reduce the perception of DOMS

Smith Keating Holbert et al (1994) hypothesized that athletic massage administered 2 hours after eccentric exercise could disrupt the initial accumulation of neutrophils during the acute inflammatory stage This disruption may lead to diminished inflammatory response and concomitant reduction in DOMS and serum CK levels

# Study Overview

In the study by Smith et al (1994) untrained males were randomly assigned to massage (N=7) or control (N=7) group All participants performed five sets of isokinetic eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors and extensors Two hours post-exercise the massage group received 30-minute athletic massage while the control group rested Delayed onset muscle soreness and CK levels were assessed before exercise and at 8 24 48 72 96 and 120 hours post-exercise Circulating neutrophils and cortisol levels were also measured at various intervals

A trend analysis revealed significant ( < 005) treatment by time interaction effect for:

- Perception of DOMS
- CK levels with the massage group displaying reduced levels
- Neutrophils with the massage group showing prolonged elevation
- Cortisol with the massage group showing diminished diurnal reduction

The results suggest that sports massage can reduce DOMS and CK levels when administered 2 hours after eccentric exercise potentially due to reduced neutrophil emigration and/or higher serum cortisol levels

# Massage Techniques and Muscle Tightness

Massage is believed to encourage circulation and reduce excess edema which may help alleviate symptoms of DOMS (Rodenburg et al 1994; Smith et al 1994; Ernst 1998; Lowe 2003) However these conclusions are controversial as other studies have questioned the significance of massage in reducing DOMS (Weber and Servedio et al 1994; Tiidus and Shoemaker 1995; Field 1998; Lowe 2003)

Assessment of muscle involvement is conducted through selective tissue tension application Pain is reported during resisted muscle contraction and involvement is confirmed by palpation Local transverse friction massage and sports massage are effective treatments To target the muscle belly the client should be positioned comfortably with the muscle in shortened position relieving tension

One key indication for utilizing massage techniques is the reduction of muscle tightness (Lowe 2003) Muscles often tighten in response to excessive neuromuscular stimulation Research has shown that massage techniques can significantly reduce this excessive stimulation (Morelli et al 1991; Sullivan et al 1991; Braverman and Schulman 1999) Liebenson (1989) found massage to be one of the most effective treatments for reducing muscle tension

# Massage and Tendon Health

Several studies have focused on tendons rather than muscle bellies providing strong evidence that massage can aid in fibroblast proliferation in tendons with significant collagen degeneration (Davidson et al 1997; Brosseau et al 2002; Cook et al 2000)

Massage with the muscle in shortened position typically decreases pain and increases the range of movement by improving circulation The increase in range of movement should be followed up with exercise in pain-free range The analgesic effect of massage is well documented (Field 2000; Yates 2004)

Pain is multifactorial and complex phenomenon and the mechanisms for reducing pain through massage are varied These mechanisms include:

- Muscle relaxation
- Improved circulation
- Deactivation of trigger points
- Release of endorphins and serotonin
- The pain gate theory
- Promotion of restful sleep (Benjamin and Lamp 2005)

# Acute Treatment of Osteoarthrosis

reference 

# Acute Treatment

# Osteoarthrosis of the Elbow

Osteoarthrosis (OA) of the elbow is often secondary to old fractures that have involved the articular surfaces of the elbow This condition may lead to the formation of loose bodies causing "pseudo locking" of the joint and restricting movement Clients often develop technique to unlock the joint themselves If loose bodies are evident on X-ray they should be removed to reduce future occurrences of locking and to minimize the risk of further damage to the articular surface of the elbow joint Elbow replacements are relatively rare

# Acute Treatment

# Cryotherapy

Ice or cold treatment commonly referred to as cryotherapy is the initial treatment of choice for virtually all acute conditions involving injuries to the musculoskeletal system (Cox 1993) This treatment may take the of cold packs ice towels cold baths or ice massage (Kitchen 2004) Cryotherapy can be used to control acute inflammation and accelerate recovery from injury or trauma

Due to the low thermal conductivity of underlying subcutaneous fat tissues short applications of cryotherapy are ineffective in cooling deeper tissues Therefore longer treatments of 20–30 minutes are recommended Cold treatments are understood to be more effective and efficient in reaching deeper tissues than most forms of heat (Prentice 2004) Ice should be applied to the injured area until signs and symptoms of inflammation have resolved It is recommended to use ice for at least 72 hours after an acute injury (Calabrese and Rooney 1986; Cox 1993) Griffin (1997) suggests that re-warming begins about 20 seconds after the preceding application and statistically significant decreases in temperature can be produced with repeated applications of cryotherapy

Cold applied to an acute injury lowers metabolism in the injured area reducing tissue demands for oxygen and thus decreasing hypoxia This benefit extends to uninjured tissue preventing tissue death from spreading to adjacent normal cellular structures Cold may also reduce reflex muscle guarding and spastic conditions that accompany pain with its pain-relieving effects being one of its greatest clinical benefits (Prentice 2004)

With ice treatment applied for 20–30 minutes the athlete may report an uncomfortable feeling of cold followed by "burning" sensation an aching and finally complete numbness (Calabrese 1986; Cox 1993) Cooling reduces swelling (Basur et al 1976) It is important to note that cooling is often not done in isolation during an acute injury; it is frequently accompanied by compression making it difficult to attribute benefits solely to cooling Cold treatment may lead to reduction in bleeding likely due to decrease in blood flow which is more pronounced during the early phase of treatment Sauls (1999) reviewed the evidence for the efficacy of cooling for pain relief noting benefits for certain orthopedic procedures and injections in adults

# Ultrasound

Ultrasound should be applied in pulsed mode at low intensity during the acute phase of inflammation to minimize the risk of aggravating the condition and to accelerate recovery Mast cells release histamine key chemical that modifies the wound after injury Research has shown that single treatment using therapeutic ultrasound in the early acute stage of the healing process can stimulate mast cells to degranulate and release histamine into the surrounding tissues (Fyfe and Chahl 1982; Hamilton 1986)

It is hypothesized that one of the effects of ultrasound is to stimulate mast cells to degranulate by increasing their permeability to calcium Mast cells play crucial role in orchestrating early repair sequences (Clark 1990) Histamine release from mast cells causes vasodilation and increases cell permeability due to the swelling of endothelial cells Vasodilation and active hyperemia are important for plasma formation and supplying leukocytes to the injured area aiding in the early formation of clot or plug

# The Elbow

# Therapeutic Ultrasound

Drainage and localise the injury response (Prentice 2004)

Young and Dyson (1990) found that using ultrasound at an intensity of 05W/cm2 and frequency of 30 MHz appeared the most effective setting on the stimulation of fibroblast (“building-block”) population growth

For many years therapeutic ultrasound was mistakenly thought of as an anti-inflammatory modality in the rehabilitator’s “tool kit” (Reid 1981; Snow and Johnson 1988) It is easy to see why there was this error in clinical reasoning as often rapid resolution of oedema was noted after using ultrasound (El Hag et al 1985) It is unfortunate that the evidence to enlighten our reasoning on this was available from as early as 1978 by Hustler Zarod and Williams At that time “evidence-based practice” was not part of the undergraduate programme in the way it is embedded into current practice Goddard et al (1983) identified in their research that ultrasound encourages oedema formation to occur more quickly and to accelerate the inflammatory phase therefore accelerating the wound into the proliferative stage of healing more effectively and efficiently than “sham” irradiated ultrasound groups A few years later similar findings were reported by Fyfe and Chahl (1985)

Binder and colleagues (1985) reported significantly enhanced recovery in clients with lateral epicondylitis treated with ultrasound compared with those treated with sham ultrasound Robertson and Baker (2001) in their review of the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound found it was difficult to compare studies as few of them had adequate methodology and covered wide range of conditions Also the dosages used in the studies varied considerably often for no discernable reason This was further complicated when more than one electrotherapy modality was used (Herrera-Lasso and Fernandez Dominguez 1993; Nussbaum et al 1994; van der Heijden et al 1999)

Surveys on the use of therapeutic physical agents in rehabilitation in the USA Canada England Australia and the Netherlands have all concluded that ultrasound therapy is by far the most widely used physical agent currently available to clinicians (Robinson and Snyder-Mackler 1988; ter Harr et al 1988; Lindsey et al 1990 1995; Robertson and Spurritt 1998; Roebroeck et al 1998) This was supported by recent systematic review by Chinn and Clough (2007) Clinicians are utilising treatment modalities in more enlightened way in clinical practice Note: ultrasound is not pain modulation therapy but can be used clinically depending on desired effect to assist with the management of inflammation and initial healing

# Corticosteroids

An alternative intervention to therapeutic ultrasound would be the use of corticosteroid injection The suggested guide for dose by the Society of Orthopaedic Medicine is dosage of approx 10mg total volume in mixture of triamcinalone acetonide (in small 025 ml concentrated dose of KENALOG or an equivalent mixed with 075 ml of local anaesthetic) which aims to reduce the inflammation Good results have been shown in the short term by several different research groups (Price et al 1991; Haker and Lundeberg 1993; Assendelft et al 1996; Verhaar et al 1996; Hay et al 1999)

Different general practitioners and injecting therapists favour differing commercial drugs Price and his team (1991) found quicker relief from pain and reduction in the requirement for repeat injections using 10mg of triamcinalone compared to using 25 mg of hydrocortisone or lidocaine alone in the short term There is currently move to increasing doses in some areas (particularly in the shoulder) however Price et al (1991) found that an increased volume injection of 20 mg of triamcinalone produced similar clinical results to 10mg and the higher dosage was much more likely to produce skin atrophy

Skin atrophy is side effect of injection However the more significant but very rare complication of injection is anaphylaxis which is described as rapid and often unanticipated life-threatening syndrome It requires very prompt action in order to treat the resulting laryngeal oedema bronchospasm hypotension and associated tachycardia

The CSP Clinical Guideline for the Use of Injection Therapy by Physiotherapists (CSP 1999) provides guidance on the management of anaphylactic shock:

- Stop delivery of the drug
- Call medical help
- Administer adrenaline
- Administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation

# Acute Treatment

# Table 184: Aims and Contra-indications of TFM

|Key Aims|Contra-indications|
|---|---|
|To produce therapeutic movement|Infection|
|To induce pain relief|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)|
|To produce traumatic hyperaemia in chronic lesions| |
|To improve functional movement| |

Hospitals and alternative health care settings have local policies and protocols in place and the reader is advised to check on local policies and procedures that are in place as injection therapy is increasing in practice but still has areas of controversy Most physiotherapists in most health settings are not allowed to mix drugs (corticosteroid and local anaesthetic) as mixing drugs is outside of the scope of practice They may inject but only having obtained an authorised prescription

# Graded Transverse Friction Massage (TFM)

It is essential to have high level of applied anatomy in order to achieve effective results with this technique It requires accurate localisation to the exact side of the lesion to be graded (gentle or deep) transverse friction massage at 90 degree/transverse sweep to the direction of the fibres in order to discourage the stationary attitude of fibres that promote anomalous cross-link formation

There are four key aims of TFM and two contraindications as shown in Table 184 Caution should be taken and clinical judgement used with regards to the use of TFM with diabetic clients and also to clients who are long-term steroid users due to potential effects on the connective tissue

# Grade A (Pain-free) Mobilisation

A grade A mobilisation is an active passive or active/assisted movement performed within the client’s pain-free range of movement It is normally applied to painful or acutely inflamed lesions Often it is made possible by preceding the grade A mobilisation with the application of graded transverse friction massage (Saunders 2000)

There are 5 key aims of transverse friction massage:

- To promote tissue agitation
- To prevent stationary attitude of fibres
- To apply longitudinal stress
- To promote normal function
- To reduce loose (it is recommended this is practised on postgraduate course)

# Kinetic Chains and Appropriate Graded Exercise

In the elbow to enhance muscular balance and neuromuscular control exercises of the surrounding agonists and antagonists should be included Exercise should be appropriate to the stage of healing and of the appropriate grade and type

It is common practice to classify exercises as “closed” or “open” chains An open chain exists when the hand is not in contact with the ground so the distal segment is mobile and is not fixed (Hillman 1994; Prentice 2004) In closed chain the hand is weight-bearing so the distal segment is fixed or stabilised

The literature shows clear trend to support the fact that “closed” chains should precede any progression to “open” chains but most of the research has been conducted using the lower limb (Cohen 2001) In the elbow closed chain exercises should be used in order to improve the dynamic stability of the more proximal muscles surrounding the elbow in sports where the elbow is required to provide more proximal stability Open chain exercises for strengthening flexion extension pronation and supination are essential to regain high-velocity dynamic movements of the elbow that are required in sports requiring throwing type activities (Prentice 2004)

There are advantages and disadvantages to both open and closed exercise Fowler (2008 p18) sets out an argument in his paper that “this classification is flawed and the rationale for it questioned”
---
# The Elbow - Physiotherapy Knowledge

# The Elbow

Reviewing the literature Fowler concludes on page 20: “The critical differences between the exercises described in the majority of the literature is not that they are open or closed but that they involve either single joint or combination of joints” This may be an accurate conclusion from biomechanical standpoint but the concept of open and closed chains is concept that is relatively easy to convey to an athlete and is widely used to good clinical effect in clinical practice It is more appropriate that the clinician utilizes their skills of applied anatomy and clinically reasons to decide on the most appropriate exercise and to review its effects than to become too focused on pedantic points of terminology to the detriment of applied clinical practice

# Grading of Exercises

The Society of Orthopaedic Medicine uses grades: A B and C

- Grade A: Defined as pain-free active passive or resisted exercise
- Grade B: A mobilization performed at the end of available range It is specific cyclical sustained stretching technique in the plastic range The aim is to cause permanent elongation of connective tissue
- Grade C: For example the Mills manipulation which is manipulative technique It is passive technique performed at the end of available range It is minimal amplitude high-velocity thrust (Kesson and Atkins 2005)

# Factors Relating to Return to Sport

# Understanding the Pathomechanics of Injury

The chapter has outlined common acute and overuse injuries It is essential that thorough working knowledge of applied anatomy and the principles of biomechanics are appreciated in order to identify existing and potential adaptive or compensatory movements (Kirkendall et al 2001)

# Understanding the Relationship of the Healing Process to Exercise Intensity

Progression or adaptation of rehabilitation program should be based on stages of healing of the injury Exercise that is too “high demand” in terms of time or intensity is likely to be detrimental to progress

It is helpful to be aware of signs that the intensity of exercises being used in the program are excessive for the stage of healing Signs to look out for are:

- Increase in the pain client reports
- Loss of range of movement
- Plateau in progress
- Increase in the laxity of healing ligament (Tippett and Voight 1999)

# Multi-Disciplinary Team Approach and Establishing Agreed Short-term or Long-term Goals

In order to achieve maximum potential in an effective manner it is key that the roles of the team are clear and understood to reduce conflict in management and avoid confusing the athlete It is essential to review goals as progress is made It is critical that the athlete is actively involved in the rehabilitation process (Piccininni and Drover 1999)

# Restoration of Muscular Strength Endurance Power and Neuromuscular Control

All these elements are essential to restore the athlete to pre-injury status A functional strengthening program should include exercises that include all three planes of movement and concentrate on combination of concentric eccentric and isometric exercise (Clark 2001) This must also ensure appropriate loading velocity and muscle actions required by the individual’s sport

# Therapeutic versus Conditioning Exercise

Therapeutic exercise focuses on the specific injury and exercises to facilitate and enhance recovery It is also essential to maintain the conditioning of the client by ensuring their level of fitness is maintained The term “therapeutic exercise” is more widely used to indicate exercise used in rehabilitation program (Kisner and Colby 1996)

# Case Study

Emily is 38-year-old university administrator who has developed over the past month pain she rates as 7/10 on the lateral aspect of her elbow
---
# Case Study: Lateral Epicondylitis

# Case Study: Lateral Epicondylitis

# Patient Background

Emily reports an uncomfortable “ache” when she is typing answering the phone writing and also when holding her coffee mug She experiences discomfort most of the time

As member of the tennis league playing tennis is particularly painful for her Although she cannot recall specific injury during focused history taking Emily remembers forceful missed shot in the final game of tournament about month ago which resulted in local pain at the time She had also changed her racquet around the same time and had been practicing for longer periods to prepare for this important game Emily is keen to participate in tournament in 2 months’ time

Upon presentation Emily reports local pain over the lateral aspect of the elbow which has now spread into the forearm wrist and back of the hand The onsite University Sport Injury clinic has diagnosed her with lateral epicondylitis commonly known as “tennis elbow” at the teno-osseous site

# Principles of Management for Emily

# Rest

Emily should ideally rest from all activities that aggravate her condition both in work and sport While compromise may be necessary rest is the most crucial factor in resolving the issue Options for rest include:

- An epicondylitis clasp or proprioceptive strapping to limit end-of-range extension
- A plaster back slab to rest from aggravating movements

She should maintain active movement within pain-free range

# Mills Manipulation

This technique is performed after preparation through transverse friction massage until analgesia is achieved Mills manipulation is only indicated if the source of the tennis elbow is at the teno-osseous site and if the patient has full range extension of the elbow This is important because:

- If full extension is available the manipulation force will target adhesions improving range of motion and reducing pain
- If full elbow extension is not available the manipulation force may impact the elbow joint potentially causing traumatic arthritis

Accurate localization of the problem is essential as performing Mills manipulation on other sites would be inappropriate It is strongly advised to attend Society of Orthopaedic Medicine Course for training under supervision before incorporating this treatment into practice

# Graded Transverse Friction Massage (TFM)

Refer to the principles of TFM as outlined above

# Ice/Cryotherapy or Therapeutic Ultrasound

Ice treatment is beneficial during the acute phase or during acute exacerbations of chronic elbow issues which are common in tennis elbow However ice should be discontinued once acute inflammation has resolved to avoid hindering chemical reactions or circulation during the later stages of healing Research indicates that:

- Prophylactic use of ice after exercise can reduce the severity of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) which is thought to result from inflammation due to muscle and connective tissue damage caused by exercise (Jones et al 1986)
- Using ice on an area with pre-existing inflammation can effectively reduce post-activity soreness

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound is recommended during the acute phase Continuous ultrasound at high enough intensity to increase tissue temperature may be applied alongside other manual approaches to assist in resolving chronic issues accompanied by soft tissue shortening due to adhesions and scarring

# Accessory Movements

Accessory movements are joint movements that person cannot perform actively but can be facilitated by the rehabilitator The principles include:

- Fixing close to the joint with one hand
- Gently using graded passive movement to restore normal joint range of motion

# Hydrocortisone Injection

This localized anti-inflammatory injection (normally triamcinolone acetonide) is more potent than oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) It is commonly accepted for chronic injuries

# The Elbow

The use of corticosteroid injections is readily accepted for its quick and effective pain relief although it may only be temporary (Almekinders 1999) There is risk of weakening the tendon particularly in weight-bearing tendons which could lead to rupture The elbow is not at as much risk as the hip knee or ankle joint although in certain activities the upper limb could be considered weight-bearing but not to the same extent as the lower limb (Cameron 1995) In an acute injury it becomes more controversial decision to use this type of injection as it can impede the healing process by eliminating the inflammatory response Most doctors consider the use of steroid injections in acute injuries to be inappropriate The evidence on corticosteroid injections for the treatment of tennis elbow is not conclusive (Assendelft et al 1996)

In randomized controlled trial in Australia (Bisset et al 2006) researchers found that physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and active exercise had superior benefit in the first 6 weeks compared to corticosteroid injections providing reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term The significant short-term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after 6 weeks with high recurrence rates implying that this treatment should be used with caution in tennis elbow

# Re-education

This should include:

- A clear explanation of the impact of the aggravating factors on the present condition and potential for re-occurrence To work through goals with Emily focusing on return to work and sport in an informed and constructive manner
- To assess technique and approach to training:
- Looking at her tennis technique (working with the coach if possible)
- Restore full pain-free range of movement flexibility and endurance in the wrist extensor muscle group
- Pacing of her training and potential to overload Discuss breaking up activities to avoid overuse of vulnerable structures Caution her that overdoing the programme may aggravate the condition
- To consider neurodynamic involvement due to the sensitizing manoeuvres of long arm stretches and neck movements
- To maintain Emily’s general fitness whilst her specific elbow injury is being rehabilitated
- Encourage general strengthening for stability support and to correct any muscle imbalance starting with static/isometric and progressing to dynamic/isometric strength The dynamic contraction exercises can be sub-divided into lengthening (eccentric) and shortening (concentric) contractions of varying speed Include early closed chain exercises such as press-ups
- To support Emily in sensitive and constructive manner through her rehabilitation and to explore alternative ways of doing her job

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Luke Heath

# Graduate Sports Rehabilitator

Wrist and hand injuries are common in majority of sports The wrist and hand combine to an important functional unit of the upper limb This chapter will review the functional anatomy of the hand and wrist; explain the causative factors of acute soft tissue injuries of the hand and wrist; and discuss the differences between acute and chronic injuries of the hand and wrist The chapter will further provide an overview of common soft tissue injuries of the hand and wrist by detailing the assessment management and rehabilitation strategies and protocols

# Incidence of Wrist and Hand Injuries

Wrist and hand injuries are common in all types of sports These injuries range from acute traumatic fractures which can be seen in contact sports such as football rugby hockey and basketball (Aitken and Court-Brown 2008) to chronic stress and overuse injuries such as those seen in golf gymnastics and various types of racquet sports (Rettig 2004)

Over 10-season period of American Football more than 1385 injuries occurred to the hand first ray (metacarpals) and fingers (Mall et al 2008) It was also reported in this study that offensive and defensive linemen were most likely to sustain hand injuries due to the higher incidence of contact with opponents accounting for over 80% of metacarpal fractures In addition wide receivers and secondary defensive linemen were most likely to sustain finger type injuries due to tackling while handling the ball (Mall et al 2008)

In field hockey the odds of sustaining hand or finger type injury are significantly greater ( < 001) than those participating in gloved wearing sports (Bowers et al 2008) an example being ice hockey or lacrosse The same risks also apply to cricket as players have to handle the ball with bare hands (Stretch 2003)

In basketball the bulk of wrist and hand injuries can be clearly defined as either cumulative (overuse) or acute (traumatic) (Raissaki et al 2007) Furthermore the epidemiology of basketball injuries between 2005 and 2007 showed that basketball players were more likely to sustain injury during competition (327 per 1000 exposures) compared to that in training (194 per 1000 exposures) (Borowski et al 2008)

Tennis players are also prone to overuse injuries (Jacobson et al 2005) with studies showing that the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) in particular may become dysfunctional as result of prolonged or faulty technique (Montalvan et al 2006; Tagliafico et al 2009) However the differences seen in player handgrip position may offer some insight into such an injury as the Eastern grip Western or semi-Western grip will determine either radial or ulnar pathology (Tagliafico et al 2009)

Golfing injuries of the wrist are indeed rare but when they do occur they can often be devastating

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

The majority of golfing injuries for the hand and wrist occur from overuse of the common flexor tendons (Batt 1992; Murray and Cooney 1996; Jacobson et al 2005; McHardy and Pollard 2005) Furthermore this type of injury accounts for nearly 20% of all wrist injuries in amateur golf and further 20–27% in professional golf (McHardy and Pollard 2005)

Gymnastics poses another problem for athletes due to repetitive loading of the musculoskeletal system (Zlotolow and Bennett 2008) as the upper is not specifically designed to cope with such high forces As result the wrist is the second most injured site in gymnastics after the shoulder (Dobyns and Gabel 1990) which reflects the type of movement and apparatus used by athletes for this sport (Cainea and Nassarb 2005)

By comparison rock climbers face specific type of injury to the hand and fingers A strain to the finger flexor system termed ‘pulley disruption’ (Zlotolow and Bennett 2008) is closely associated with the ‘crimp-grip’ hand position which is commonly used to hold onto smaller ledges (Jebson et al 1997; Klauser et al 2002)

In the field of winter sports it is not uncommon for snowboarders and skiers to sustain different type of injury pattern (Sutherland et al 1996) which highlights the importance of individually assessing the biomechanics of each sport Although the injury pattern for both brain and spinal injuries is considered the same in each sport (McBeth et al 2009) Despite this the wrist (and forearm) and ankle are the most injured sites in snowboarding at 23% (Biasca et al 1995; McBeth et al 2009) compared to that of the knee and thumb in alpine skiing at 46% Overall the injury rate of snowboarders is comparatively higher which has important implications for the instruction of proper technique especially when beginners are involved (Sutherland et al 1996)

Sporting injuries of the wrist and hand are altogether not that uncommon accounting for around fifth of all emergencies presented to medical units within the UK (Diasa and Garcia-Eliasb 2006) In addition over £100 million is spent per year in treating those injuries (Diasa and Garcia-Eliasb 2006) Therefore the sports rehabilitator should provide adequate assistance in successfully assessing and managing those injuries if costs are to be minimized and greater understanding towards the process of injury prevention is developed as each case history unfolds

# Anatomy of the Wrist and Hand

The anatomical structure of the wrist and hand is complex network of superficial soft tissue and palpable bony landmarks whose role primarily is to perform specific motor tasks that pertain to the shoulder and that of the elbow These types of motor tasks often include hand and wrist actions such as blocking gripping catching and throwing which can be seen being performed by most of today’s athletes in almost every sport

The structure and function of the wrist and hand are unique in that the muscles joints tendons and ligaments all work together to provide stability whilst enabling the thumb and four fingers to perform intricate and often delicate movements However when optimally trained the hand can also provide powerful clasping and gripping movements such as those seen in gymnastics martial arts and rock climbing

The movements of the wrist and hand are not altogether exclusive however as the initial positioning and resultant joint actions are dependent on several muscles pertaining to the forearm Therefore careful consideration must be given to the whole kinetic chain when assessing and managing any type of injury to the upper extremity as other joints may also be involved Furthermore key understanding of the structure and function of the wrist and hand is vital for sports rehabilitators who may be embarking on careers in professional sport as the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal injuries could mean the difference between retirement and recovery

# Bones

The wrist and hand are comprised of 27 bones and more than 20 joints of which there are 8 carpal bones 5 metacarpal bones and 14 phalanges The motion of these bones is somewhat complex as movement occurs in three dimensions and remains incompletely defined (Moorea et al 2007)

The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone of the carpals (Rizzo and Shin 2006) with the mechanism of injury occurring from compression of the wrist while in extension as during block or fall Blood flow can also become disrupted leading to complications in wound healing Dislocations of the capitate with the lunate may also occur as result of scaphoid fractures termed ‘perilunate dislocation’

# Injury Mechanism

Injury is often result of forced extension coupled with axial loading and compression of the wrist (Bathala and Murray 2007)

# Joints

The joints of the wrist and hand can be classified by their anatomical location and articulation with one another forming the following joints:

- Radiocarpal joint (RC)
- Midcarpal joint (MC)
- Carpometacarpal joint (CMC)
- Metacarpophalangeal joint (MP)
- Interphalangeal joint (IP)

# Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC)

The TFCC which includes the lunate and triquetral is often referred to as common site for high intensity and chronic overuse injuries in sports (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006; Tagliafico et al 2009) The triangular fibrocartilage is particularly susceptible to injury due to forced extension and pronation leading to issues such as joint instability disc degeneration and altered force distribution between the distal radial and ulnar joints (Melone and Nathan 1992)

# Ligaments

Several ligaments contribute to the stability of the radiocarpal joint including:

- Collateral ligaments
- Palmar ligaments
- Dorsal ligaments

These ligaments allow for movement in flexion extension abduction and adduction

# Radiocarpal Joint

The radiocarpal joint of the wrist is formed by the articulation of the radius with the scaphoid and lunate bones along with the triangular fibrocartilage complex

# Midcarpal Joint

The midcarpal joint is formed by two rows of carpals:

- Proximal row: scaphoid lunate triquetral and pisiform
- Distal row: trapezium trapezoid capitate and hamate
---
# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Carpal Bones and Joints

The carpal bones are closely packed together by intercarpal ligaments (dorsal palmar and interosseous) As result flexion and abduction of the wrist occur more at the midcarpal joint with extension and adduction greater at the radiocarpal joint

# Carpometacarpal Joint

The carpometacarpal joints of the hand are formed by close articulation with the distal row of carpals and the five metacarpal bones with the first carpometacarpal joint being that of the thumb classed as separate The carpometacarpal joints are held together by dorsal and palmar ligaments which allow for only small degree of movement in joint glide

The thumb also has lateral ligament and due to its anatomical configuration allows for greater range of movement than the opposing fingers; allowing flexion extension abduction adduction opposition and reposition

# Metacarpalphalangeal Joints

The metacarpalphalangeal joints are where the fingers begin to become distinct from the hand These are comprised of the five metacarpal bones articulating with the five proximal phalanges The deep transverse metacarpal ligament holds all the MP joints together allowing for flexion extension abduction and adduction

The second and third MP joints are quite rigid making up the major stabilizer for the hand whereas the fourth and fifth joints become increasingly mobile in order to initiate the action that permits the closed grip of the hand

The first metacarpalphalangeal joint of the thumb is separate from the other MP joints to allow for greater abduction and adduction In addition the collateral ligament complex also provides stability allowing for the thumb to adopt any position on the palmar aspect of the hand and to provide precision grip to the distal phalanges

An injury to the collateral ligament is particularly common in sports where the thumb is exposed resulting in trauma from forced abduction and hyperextension often from direct contact with an opponent In traumatic circumstances such as this the stability of the joint can become compromised leading to the need for medical intervention and wound repair

# Interphalangeal Joints

The interphalangeal joints of the fingers are expressed as the proximal PIP and distal DIP interphalangeal joints the DIP being furthest away from the hand The interphalangeal joints are held closely together by collateral ligaments which remain taut in both flexion and extension unlike the collateral ligaments of the metacarpalphalangeal joints which are loose in extension

The collateral ligaments of the fingers are common injury sustained in physical activity occurring mainly in field and contact sports such as football and rugby

# Muscles

There are five muscles that act on the wrist joint These are the flexor group: flexor carpi radialis palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris and the extensor group: extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi ulnaris

It is worth noting that small percentage of individuals do not possess the palmaris longus which aids to tighten the palmar fascia

There are several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the hand which co-exist to produce movement for the thumb and fingers Three extrinsic muscles act on all four fingers These include flexor digitorum superficialis flexor digitorum profundus and extensor digitorum Two smaller muscles also help to assist with extension of the index finger and fifth finger respectively These are extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi

Disruption of the finger flexor tendon pulley is one of the most frequently occurring injuries in rock climbing due to bowstringing of the tendon during the closed ‘crimp-hand’ position Considerable friction has also been shown to be apparent in study reporting that the fingers particularly at 90-degree flexion stress the PIP joint

There are total of 11 intrinsic muscles in the hand that act upon the proximal phalanges and middle and distal phalanges These muscles include 4 lumbricals 4 dorsal and 3 palmar interossei muscles that lie between the metacarpal bones The muscles most commonly injured within the hand are the interossei usually by overstretching the fingers Pain and swelling are often localized and restriction
---
# Assessment and Management of Wrist and Hand Injuries

# Extrinsic Muscles of the Wrist and Hand

In movement occurring in either abduction (dorsal interossei) or adduction (plantar interossei) eight muscles co-exist to produce the movements of the thumb These include:

- Extensor pollicis longus
- Extensor pollicis brevis
- Abductor pollicis longus
- Flexor pollicis longus

These muscles are extrinsic in origin Additionally the following muscles converge to the thenar eminence:

- Flexor pollicis brevis
- Opponens pollicis
- Abductor pollicis brevis
- Adductor pollicis

Three more intrinsic muscles of the hand act on the little finger including:

- Abductor digiti minimi
- Flexor digiti minimi brevis
- Opponens digiti minimi

These muscles converge on the medial aspect of the hand to the hypothenar eminence

# Clinical Examination

Clinical examination of the wrist and hand is necessary in order to delineate injured structures and to assess the need for referral The protocol of assessment most commonly recognized in the UK for sports rehabilitation is SOAP (Brown et al 2007) the acronym for:

- Subjective
- Objective
- Assessment
---
# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

Because of the superficial nature and complexity of the wrist and hand thorough knowledge of structural and functional anatomy should be gained beforehand in order to understand the extent of any musculoskeletal injury

# Range of Motion

Wrist and hand motions occur in variety of different planes which can often be thought of as corresponding to the joint actions of the elbow and the shoulder Testing includes active and passive movements for:

- Wrist: flexion extension radial and ulnar deviation
- MCP joints: flexion extension abduction and adduction
- Interphalangeal joints: flexion and extension
- Thumb: flexion extension abduction adduction and circumduction

The purpose of range of motion assessment is to assess physiological and accessory motion to differentiate injury between anatomical structures and to assess end feel for abnormal movement

# Special Testing

Special tests of the wrist and hand extend to physiological neurological and also vascular examinations to conclude or exclude pathology These tests include examinations to both soft tissue and bony articulations for the presence of acute and chronic inflammation stress fractures and underlying medical conditions

# Objective Assessment

# Palpation

Palpation should occur with the athlete seated with the forearm wrist and hand in relaxed position

# Functional Assessment

Functional assessment is component that is often overlooked during injury assessment as it is important to gauge the physical capabilities of the athlete Several exercises can be used here to assess functional capacity of the wrist and hand which include sports-specific activities already performed by the athlete In turn this will help assess motion stability strength balance and coordination

The rehabilitator may also perform an individualized approach towards injury assessment through the use of differential diagnosis Here the assessment of other closely affected structures of the wrist and hand namely the head neck shoulder and elbow are conducted to measure the extent of those injuries In addition testing should also always be

# Acute Soft Tissue Injuries

# Acute Soft Tissue Injuries

Athletes participating in high intensive and contact sports will no doubt be affected by acute soft tissue injuries The role of the sports rehabilitator therefore is to work on minimizing those risks while focusing on rehabilitating those injuries The classification of acute soft tissue injuries can be subdivided into sprains strains and contusions

# Common UK Sporting Wrist and Hand Injuries

Research has shown that there are number of common wrist and hand injuries that readily occur within UK sports (Rettig 2004) The bulk of these injuries are sustained from the very nature of participating in these sports For the purposes of review the most common injuries will be discussed together with assessment and conservative management according to the scope of practice for GRSs who operate exclusively within the UK The full list of injuries however can be seen illustrated as they are presented according to each sport (Table 191)

# Gamekeeper's Thumb

A common injury sustained by players in football and hockey the gamekeeper’s thumb is sprain of the ulnar collateral ligament also termed the ‘skier’s thumb’ for the mechanism in which the injury is sustained

# Signs and Symptoms

An athlete with gamekeeper’s thumb will present with pain and swelling on the palmar aspect of the thumb joint between the web space of the thumb and the hand Palpation will show palpable defect in the instance of full rupture with instability evident on bilateral comparison with the thumb in abduction Partial ruptures will elicit moderate joint laxity with definite end feel Further investigation by imaging can also confirm suspicion of tendon avulsions

# Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury

The ulnar collateral ligament particularly in the thumb has good capacity to heal without complications when there are no Stener lesions Following successful rehabilitation athletes can return to sporting activities Full return to sport is considered once the athlete has regained full functional range of motion (ROM) with 90% strength of the unaffected part and minimal pain and swelling (Stracciolini et al 2007)

For football (soccer) goalkeepers and rugby players preventative taping can be effective in aiding thumb joint stability and preventing further injury In sports where no catching is required thumb brace can provide an alternative means to permanent wrist support (Alexy and De Carlo 1998)

# Management

In the immediate instance of injury to the ulnar collateral ligament ice packs and compression are the best forms of treatment (Janoff 1999) Ultrasound can also be effective in the early stages to diagnose injury (Chuter et al 2009; Malik et al 2009) followed by massage and mobilization to aid in ligament repair and restore function (Alexy and De Carlo 1998) Thumb strength and dexterity can be improved by using hand therapy balls and therapeutic putty (Alexy and De Carlo 1998; Shafer-Crane 2006; Wilson et al 2008) whereas grip and thumb strengthening devices may be useful in restoring normal hand and thumb motion

# Complications in Healing

In cases of complete rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament further medical intervention may be necessary The ruptured ligament may become entangled in the soft tissue at the base of the thumb known as “Stener lesion” complicating conservative management and delaying wound healing (Ebrahim et al 2006)

# Mallet Finger

Mallet finger is another common injury sustained in field and contact sports resulting from forceful flexion of an extended distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint such as when player mistimes shot or catch

# Signs and Symptoms

An athlete with mallet finger will present with pain at the dorsal DIP joint and an inability to actively extend the joint demonstrating characteristic flexion deformity If the tendon is only partially stretched movement may be restricted by 15–20 degrees of extension However if full rupture is present movement will be limited by 30–40 degrees of extension although full passive motion is typically preserved (Micheo 2003)

# Management

The majority of mallet finger injuries are treated conservatively with rehabilitation Ice packs can be useful to relieve pain in the early stages The terminal interphalangeal joint (the joint in the finger closest to its tip) should be splinted in slight hyperextension (an overly straightened position) without immobilizing any of the other joints of the injured finger (Janoff 1999) This position can then be maintained to allow time for wound healing
---
# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Treatment

Treatment includes active DIP flexion exercises (making full fist) that act to regain strength and mobility of the injured finger This should be practiced without the splint for 10 minutes every hour for the first two weeks (Teoh and Lee 2007) followed by several weeks of DIP flexion exercises with an extended PIP joint (Walshaw 2004)

# Complications in Healing

It is important to isolate the DIP joint during evaluation to ensure extension is from the extensor tendon and not the central slip the absence of full passive extension possibly indicating bony or soft tissue entrapment (Bach 1999; Lee and Montgomery 2002) Furthermore bony avulsion fractures are present in one-third of patients with mallet finger (Lairmore and Engber 1998; Palmer 1998)

# Injury Prevention

In sports such as basketball cricket and rugby it may be sensible to tape the fingers to provide further support to the joints In individuals with previous history it is wise to wear finger splint as protection

# Jersey Finger

A disruption of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon also known as jersey finger commonly occurs when an athlete’s finger catches on another player’s clothing usually while playing team sport such as football or rugby As the athlete pulls away the finger is forcibly straightened while the profundus flexor tendon continues to contract The ring finger is the weakest digit of the four fingers accounting for 75% of all reported cases (Hankins and Peel 1990)

# Signs and Symptoms

An athlete with jersey finger will present with pain and swelling at the volar aspect of the DIP joint and will be unable to bend the tip of the affected finger Tenderness may also be felt elsewhere along the finger or hand if the profundus tendon has become retracted The digitorum profundus tendon can be evaluated by holding the affected finger’s MCP and PIP joints in extension while the rest remain in flexion and performing concentric contraction of the affected DIP joint (Hankins and Peel 1990) A positive sign for rupture to the digitorum profundus tendon is that the DIP joint should not move

# Management

Immediate management of jersey finger includes diagnostic imaging to confirm suspicion of an avulsion fracture as complications can quickly arise in the case of tendon retractions (Mastey et al 1997) Athletes with confirmed or suspected jersey finger should also be referred for medical consultation Following medical intervention rehabilitation should consist of passive range of motion exercises followed by return to normal activity only after period of several weeks during which time movement is restricted in order to promote wound repair

# Boutonnière Deformity

A common injury to the central slip extensor tendon (boutonnière deformity) occurs when the PIP joint is forcibly flexed while actively extended It is common injury among basketball players Volar dislocation of the PIP joint can also cause central slip tendon ruptures (Perron et al 2001)

# Signs and Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of boutonnière deformity include pain and localized swelling to the PIP joint The PIP joint should be evaluated by holding the joint in position of 15–30 degrees of flexion If the PIP joint is injured then the athlete will be unable to actively extend the joint; however passive extension will be possible Tenderness over the dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx will also be present

# Management

The PIP joint should be splinted in full extension for the first six weeks of healing and in cases where no avulsion has taken place or the avulsion involves less than one third of the joint All available splints can be used to treat PIP injuries except for the stack splint which is used only for DIP injuries As with mallet finger extension of the PIP joint must be maintained continuously If full passive extension is not possible then the rehabilitator should refer the athlete

# Acute Soft Tissue Injuries

# Acute Soft Tissue Injuries

# Complications in Healing

If an avulsion fracture is present on imaging then medical intervention may be necessary to prevent future complications as delay in the proper treatment may cause permanent deformity A boutonnière deformity usually develops over period of several weeks as the intact lateral bands of the extensor tendon slip inferiorly However boutonnière deformity can also occur more acutely

# Injury Prevention

In sports such as basketball cricket and rugby it may be sensible to tape the fingers to provide further support to the joints Athletes with PIP joint injuries may also continue to participate in athletic events during the splinting period although some sports are difficult to play with fully extended PIP joints

# Extensor Pollicis Longus Rupture

A tendon rupture of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) is recognized complication of distal radial fractures and their fixation with dorsal radial plates and pins A number of other conditions including internal fixation of wrist fractures and inflammatory arthropathies have also been reported as aetiological factors of EPL tendon rupture (Ansede et al 2009)

# Management

The EPL tendon is complex and if rupture occurs then medical intervention may be necessary The standard procedure for this type of injury is to use the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendon The tendon is then transferred from its normal location to replace the function of the EPL However there are some disadvantages to using the EIP as Bullon (2007) states that the EPL may not have sufficient tendons; therefore using the accessory abductor pollicis longus (AAPL) is preferred as transference can then be conducted without affecting the function of the APL

# Complications in Healing

Not all people have this tendon as it is present in approximately 85% of the general population However Bullon (2007) states that the AAPL could be used successfully in restoring the function of the ruptured EPL as everyday newer surgical procedures are being conducted which have many advantages over other tendon transfers for this type of injury Wimsey Kurian and Jeffery (2006) also state that there is conservative approach to this condition which would be to immobilize the wrist joint in mallet splint for 12 weeks However this approach would only be advocated for the younger population as complications can occur from immobilization of the joints such as muscle atrophy and weakness which will hinder effective management

# Other Acute Soft Tissue Injuries

# Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears

The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) sits between the distal end of the ulna and the triquetrum and part of the lunate It consists of the triangular fibrocartilage the ulnar meniscus homolog the ulnar collateral ligament carpal ligaments and the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath Testing for the TFCC involves placing the wrist in extension and ulnar deviation and then rotating This movement as in the forehand volley relates to overloading of the complex

The integrity of the TFCC is closely bound up with the stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) In study by Adlercreutz Aspenberg and Lindau (2000) it was shown that complete tear of the TFCC is almost always associated with instability of the DRUJ Instability of the DRUJ is also associated with generalized capsuloligamentous laxity Often pain on the ulnar side of the wrist is multifactorial and stability-related Another underlying cause of compression injuries to the TFCC is ulnar variance

# Collateral Ligament Sprains

Collateral ligament injuries of the MCP PIP and IP joints can occur in many types of sport Injuries of the collateral ligaments of the MCP joints are seldom but instability can present if the tear is complete Injury to the PIP joint is quite common in athletes and team sports such as volleyball basketball and rugby The majority of collateral ligament injuries can be treated by splinting or taping the affected part to the adjacent fingers known as ‘buddy taping’ in order to provide additional support (Sennet 2004)
---
# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Wrist Sprains

Wrist sprains typically occur after trip or fall resulting in stretching or tearing of the ligaments of the wrist Common causes of wrist sprain include falls during team sports such as when basketball player is tackled during jump shot or rugby player barged from the side Moreover if the tissues are inflexible and weak the risk of injury increases However the majority of these injuries can be treated conservatively and seldom result in prolonged loss of sporting activity

# Contusions

Contusions of the wrist and hand are common injury because of the many superficial tendons and bony prominences that are exposed Contusions are rarely serious and can be treated conservatively over time However care must be taken not to rule out more serious injury such as ligament sprains tendon injuries and joint fractures

# Chronic and Overuse Injuries

Repetitive actions can take their toll in team and action sports resulting in chronic inflammatory issues and degenerative pathologies The repetitive cycle of injury that can occur from an acute injury that is poorly managed is also source of chronic instability resulting in faulty recruitment from scar tissue chronic inflammation and irritation from repetitive forces In sports such as tennis gymnastics and rock climbing the wrists are exposed to greater frequency of joint irritation from the dissipation of load through the upper extremity Therefore the role of the sports rehabilitator is to work on breaking the cycle of injury and promote effective wound healing and in instances where injuries are idiopathic in nature to work on minimizing those risks to aid in ensuring longevity for the athlete and their sport

# De Quervain's Disease

De Quervain’s disease (also known as Hoffmann’s disease) is an inflammation and thickening of the synovial lining of the common sheath of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons

Figure 195 De Quervain’s disease (example) Reproduced with permission from Clinical Practice of Sports Injury Prevention and Care: Olympic Encyclopaedia of Sports Medicine Volume V Renstrom PA F H (1994)
---
# Chronic and Overuse Injuries

# Chronic and Overuse Injuries

# Signs and Symptoms

The common sheath provides support to the tendons to prevent bowstringing when the wrist is in extension (Rettig 2004) Therefore space inside the sheath is limited Thickening occurs particularly at the distal portion of the radial styloid There is often pain in resisted thumb extension and abduction and while passively moving the wrist in ulnar deviation keeping the thumb fully flexed (Finkelstein’s test) (Van Tulder et al 2007) There is also local tenderness on palpation and with the tendon on stretch crepitus to repeated movements

# Management

De Quervain’s disease responds well to frictional massage with the tendons in lengthened position and immobilisation of the thumb joint in splint (McCarroll 2001; Coldham 2006) Corticosteroid injections may also be prescribed for persistent cases (Mason et al 2008)

# Ulnar Nerve Compression

Compression injuries of the ulnar nerve can occur between the wrist space formed between the pisiform and the hamate known as the tunnel of Guyon termed “Guyon’s canal syndrome” The symptoms are caused by compression or friction of soft tissue structures surrounding the ulnar nerve resulting in pain tingling and numbness The condition commonly affects cyclists as the wrist is compressed and extended against the handlebars

# Complications in Healing

De Quervain’s disease can often be confused with rheumatoid arthritis (Daenen et al 2004) However imaging for tendon pathology such as in the use of sonography can accurately determine number of inflammatory metabolic and infectious wrist disorders (Daenen et al 2004)

# Injury Prevention

Breaking the cycle of injury comes highly recommended for managing de Quervain’s disease (Rettig 2004) as wide variety of ergonomic factors are related to its onset The cessation of repetitive activity is the first recommendation followed by the reduction in movements that cause pain and the reporting of symptoms (Foye et al 2002) In this instance breaking the cycle is as much about educating the athlete on the long-term health benefits

# Other Chronic and Overuse Injuries

# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal tunnel syndrome is result of compression of the medial nerve as it passes beneath the flexor retinaculum and into the carpal tunnel The condition may manifest as result of swelling of the flexor tendon sheaths (tenosynovitis) as can be seen from the repetitive flexion actions caused by the wrist in sports such as gymnastics cycling and weightlifting The condition can also manifest itself as result of arthritic degenerative changes from repetitive or previous impact traumas such as wrist fractures

# Impingement Syndrome

This condition can manifest as result of forced compression of two carpal bones of the wrist Such injuries include impaction between the scaphoid or less commonly the lunate and radius with forced extension triquetrohamate impingement with forced extension and ulnar deviation and radial styloid impaction with forced radial deviation Impingement syndrome may also relate to chronic instabilities whereby increased accessory joint motion refers to greater chances of impingement during physiological movement

# Trigger Finger

Trigger finger is common name for finger tendon disruption that causes the joints to prevent from extending As the finger bends nodule on the tendon passes out of the synovial sheath coating the tendon and into the palm but as the finger straightens the nodule may not pass back into the sheath becoming lodged in its entrance The athlete may attempt to forcibly straighten the finger but this should be avoided in all circumstances

# Bone Pathology

# Scaphoid Fracture

A scaphoid fracture is the most commonly injured bone of the carpals Often occurring from sudden impact of closed wrist or during trip or fall with the wrist in full extension The injury is particularly common in contact sports such as American football rugby and martial arts but it may also occur in other types of sports such as gymnastics skiing or snowboarding

# Signs and Symptoms

An athlete with scaphoid fracture will present with swelling at the base of the thumb on the outside of the wrist (anatomical snuffbox) Palpation will elicit pain particularly with passive movements during pronation and ulnar deviation which will stress the scaphoid It is also not uncommon for scaphoid fracture to go undetected and in the event diagnostic imaging is highly recommended (Haisman et al 2006)

# Management

Acute management of scaphoid fractures is immobilisation of the wrist and thumb (Jones 2006) where support would extend from the wrist to the IP joint of the thumb but also sometimes from the elbow Rehabilitation in the early stage begins with maintaining range of movement in the shoulder and the elbow and in less complicated fractures healing can be resolved in as little as four weeks In more complicated fractures however such as fracture to the proximal bone healing may take several months Therefore maintaining muscle function in the upper extremity is imperative to prevent loss of movement

Once healing has been approved mobilisation and strengthening exercises using therapeutic putty and hand therapy balls can begin to restore full function (Vucekovich et al 2004) During this period it may also be helpful to wear wrist support when not performing exercise to aid further support

# Complications in Healing

Early diagnosis of scaphoid injuries is important as misdiagnosed or untreated fractures may lead to malunion or nonunion bone (Haisman et al 2006) Athletes with these problems would most certainly present with later issues as persistent wrist pain and abnormal kinematics can lead to wrist arthrosis Medical intervention using screw fixation may be recommended in most cases as evidence suggests that conservative management may lead to higher rate of non-union complications during healing (McQueen et al 2008)

# Case Study

# Injury Prevention

There is not much that can be done to prevent fall on an outstretched hand in most sports However in snowboarding the incidence of scaphoid injury is less due to the measure of wearing wrist guards As wrist guards have been shown to reduce the incidence of wrist injuries during falls (O’Neill 2003; Idzikowski et al 2000)

# Other Bone Pathologies

# Metacarpal Fractures

A punching type injury is the most common cause of metacarpal fractures This may occur either when the hand strikes another object (hand off) such as in handball or when player falls with closed fist hitting another solid object Sports involving this type of injury include American football boxing basketball soccer and in some cases cricket

# Bennett's Fracture

A Bennett’s fracture of the thumb (first metacarpal bone) is similar in mechanism to an MCP fracture Except in this case impact is specifically targeted at the thumb In this instance the pull of the abductor muscle causes displacement of the metacarpal bone resulting in shearing of the bone at its base Because this fracture occurs near the joint line it can also present with false joint with palpation and movement

# Finger Fractures

Finger fractures are very common in basketball and can be caused by variety of mechanisms While finger fractures are often considered minor trauma without proper treatment they can also cause major problems Conservative management involves buddy taping or splinting while the injured bone heals (Sennet 2004) and to prevent further injury These types of fractures are also sometimes referred to as hairline fractures small avulsion fractures and non-displaced fractures

# PIP Joint Dislocations

Dislocation of the PIP joint is common in sports such as handball basketball and cricket The mechanism of injury can occur in axial loading and hyperextension of the joint lateral loading and more rarely volar disruption of the PIP joint Lack of treatment may cause permanent joint deformity and in the case of more traumatic PIP dislocations fractures may also be present

# Case Study

A 31-year-old male rock climber comes to you complaining of pain in his hand and fingers whilst performing activity He was indoor-climbing during the weekend and fell whilst holding onto rock wall with bolt-on features Despite the pain he continued to climb for the rest of the afternoon and two days later after having applied athletic taping as recommended by his training partner Since then his symptoms have become much worse The management of this athlete is discussed following the headings of injury management immediate treatment restoration of motion muscular strength endurance and power and functional integration

# Injury Management

Active rehabilitation methods are highly recommended due to the increased instances of joint contractures and deformity for finger type injuries Cessation of finger type activities is also desired at this point (Wyatt et al 1996) to localize inflammation and reduce instances of pain Athletic taping however is not recommended at this point especially without prior medical consultation as research is still not yet conclusive for the efficacy of taping for rock climbing injuries (Bollen and Gunson 1990) Diagnostic imaging can also be advised at this time to determine the extent of trauma to the finger pulley (Klauser et al 2002)

# Immediate Treatment

In the instance of acute injury and soft-tissue strains several therapeutic interventions are propagated including ultrasound (US) interferential stimulation (IFS) and ice-massage (Janoff 1999) US and ice-massage may be used in combination with exercise to decrease inflammation the duration and frequency depending upon the severity of injury By using 10 minutes of ice application treatment can then be followed by 10 minutes of therapeutic exercise with the process repeated twice up

# Wrist and Hand Injuries in Sport

# Restoration of Motion

Once pain-free motion and soft-tissue flexibility have been restored close chain exercises can then be prescribed to improve dexterity The exercises used here should be the same or similar to those used in functional testing as this will mark any improvements and already be familiar to the athlete The methods used can also include the precision-grip or power-grip as used in rock climbing with specific modifications selected based on detriments in performance

# Muscular Strength Endurance and Power

Once range-of-motion and dexterity have been established open-chain exercises specific to the physiological demands of rock climbing can then be prescribed including progression of movements using hand weights and weight building the intensity until the athlete can manage 25–30 repetitions (Read 2000) Athletic taping may also be used at this point but only as preventative measure to provide further joint stability (Jebson et al 1997) It is important to note that this phase of rehabilitation is now beyond the scope of most conventional allied health professionals and is specific to sports rehabilitators Therefore steps must be taken to ensure that the athlete has successfully completed the early stages of recovery to reduce the likelihood of re-injury

# Functional Integration

If after period of periodisation the athlete is able to perform maximal strength and power tests bilaterally the rehabilitator can then introduce movements that replicate the technical aspects of the sport The biomechanics of indoor and sports climbing demand that most of the is supported by the distal phalanx and while the crimp-grip technique is mainly used it is often the position of frequent ruptures (Vigourioux et al 2008) Therefore the rehabilitation goal here is to restore the ability for the distal phalanx to cope with the transference and dissipation of load Taking the athlete back to the onsite location of the initial injury will also be helpful to assess movement and correct technique should the athlete wish to continue with sports-specific training programme with the rehabilitator

Furthermore the rate of adaptation required will be unique to each individual and level of athletic ability Therefore the rehabilitator would do well to evaluate the needs of each athlete and assessments and feedback should almost become second nature for each stage of the rehabilitation process

# Introduction

As with many words used to describe parts of the human there is lay usage and more precise anatomical meaning for both the hip and the groin The anatomy of the groin can be clinically difficult to define

Both structures can be defined primarily by position concerning the groin and by function regarding the hip within the musculoskeletal structure of the The hip joint allows the lower limb to be moved through an exceptional range of motion although the movement in the hip joint is more anterior and posterior due to anatomical structure and the functional requirement of gait

The groin consists of the structures deep to the anterior and medial intersection of the leg and the lower abdomen and includes the structures of the perineum Movement of the hip underlies and affects the groin structures Stretching and mobility exercises of the hip involve the groin muscles The groin therefore particularly includes the lower rectus abdominis musculature the inguinal region the symphysis pubis the upper portions of the adductor muscles of the thigh and the genitalia including the scrotum in males

This chapter introduces common groin injuries and pathologies associated with sport and physical activity participation The chapter provides an overview of the functionality of both the groin and hip and then details the injuries and pathologies through evidence-based analyses of the literature The chapter concludes with applied case studies illustrating the management of groin injuries and recommending suitable rehabilitation techniques and exercise protocols When reading this chapter it is important to understand injury pain and pathology in the light of function and more often dysfunction of joint motion

# Groin Pain in Sport

Groin pain is one of the most poorly understood syndromes in clinical sports medicine despite its relatively common occurrence There are many opinions and theories describing the causes of groin pain (Bradshaw et al 2008) particularly in sport but many commonly held assumptions are unsupported by robust scientific evidence There is much significant discussion in the sports medicine literature as to whether groin pain is caused predominantly by:

- single pathology presenting in various ways
- one of multiple distinct entities that need to be accurately diagnosed and treated differently
- several merging pathologies that coexist resulting in similar syndrome that requires almost the same treatment no matter what the presenting symptomatology

Part of the explanation for the resulting unsatisfactory causal and diagnostic opinions lies in the complex anatomy of the groin Patients very often become uncertain and despondent after receiving varied opinions from different highly respected clinicians only to receive conflicting and confusing information regarding the diagnosis and the way the condition should be managed treated and rehabilitated

The groin is relatively unstable area acting as the link between structures that generate large forces through it Groin pain can therefore be related to several different joints particularly the lumbar spine sacroiliac hip and pubic symphysis; the adductor hip flexor gluteal abdominal and lumbar extensor muscle groups; and even the obturator ilioinguinal and genitofemoral neural structures (Noiseux and Tanzer 2008)

The pelvis is ring of bone with the symphysis pubis joint anteriorly and the two sacroiliac joints posteriorly It links the hip joints at each side and the spine posteriorly Instability in the pelvic ring may make it difficult to diagnose symptoms and repetitive stress on the pelvic bone itself may cause stubborn stress fracture

The gluteal muscles provide stability and generate significant power during hip joint movement They are important for the transference of power between the legs and the trunk in sport The gluteus maximus extends the hip and therefore particularly contributes to propulsion and strong anti-gravity stability when balancing or pivoting on one leg Gluteus medius and minimus move the leg away from the midline and are important stabilizers of the pelvis Weakness of these muscles may well contribute to pain in the groin

The hip flexor muscles bring the thigh forward during running and kicking They are made up of the iliopsoas muscle combination The Psoas muscle originates from the lumbar spine and travels through the posterior part of the abdomen and beneath the inguinal ligament to attach on the upper part of the thigh bone Iliacus originates from inside the pelvic bone and joins psoas towards the thigh Importantly the iliopsoas connects the lumbar spine directly to the thigh over the front of the hip joint As result of its position and activity groin injury or pain may well have an effect on the function of the iliopsoas Iliopsoas status and function may also influence groin and pelvic pain

Hip adductor muscles connect the central pubic bone of the pelvis to the medial thigh They move the active leg toward and past the midline of the in activities like kicking diagonally across the They also stabilize the supporting limb during movements that require balancing on one limb such as in the repetitive kicking in karate The adductor muscles can be strained torn or even ruptured usually more proximal than distal (Tuite et al 1998; Lohrer and Nauck 2007)

The rectus abdominis internal and external oblique and transversus abdominis abdominal muscles all combine to perform pelvic movement and contribute towards stability in the trunk and pelvic region Strength imbalance and dysfunction of these muscles (Maffey and Emery 2007) may contribute to groin-related symptoms Weakness of the lower abdominal muscles (Morales-Conde 2009) may be related to condition known as ‘sportsman’s hernia’

# Overview of Groin Injuries

The quadratus lumborum muscle runs down either side of the trunk and is attached to the posterior edge of the pelvis Pain and dysfunction in other structures around the pelvis may cause secondary reactive tightness in this sheet of muscle (Kibler et al 2006) The specific posterior attachment to the pelvis combined with tension in this muscle may result in an anterior tilt of the pelvis (Hibbs et al 2008) causing impingement and torsion to the structures of particularly the anterior groin

The biomechanics around the pelvis is such that dysfunction and imbalance of any one or more of these anatomical structures can therefore result in disconnection in the chain of movement especially in the complex and stressful environment of sport (Meyers et al 2008) Therefore once sportsperson has had groin symptoms over significant period it is often the case that they will develop several related pathologies (Macintyre et al 2006) This scenario requires patient examination and re-examination sometimes over period of time to identify the main areas of dysfunction and pathology to provide the sportsperson with pragmatic and appropriate rehabilitation objectives

Accurate diagnosis is essential (Fricker 1997) (refer to Chapter 2 on screening and assessment for further information on initial clinical management of injuries) Discussion of factors that aggravate or reduce pain especially relating to the specific aspects of the athlete's sport is essential For general guidance only histories of duration longer than several months or one season are usually hip joint related whereas less than three months can be various pathologies (Verrall 2008)

# Histories must include:

Duration
Location
Onset details
Predisposing factors
Response to rest and treatment so far
Investigation history eg X-ray ultrasound MRI CT bone scan

# Assessment of Groin Pain

Groin pain can be difficult to examine and assess for variety of reasons (Harmon 2007) The history and location of pain is often ambiguous therefore the history and examination should be approached methodically (Wettstein et al 2007) to achieve as accurate diagnosis as possible

Incorporated within the varied clinical tests used assessment must ideally include:

Inspection for asymmetry and anatomical irregularity including poor habitual posture

# The Groin in Sport

# Assessment of the Range of Motion of the Joints

- Assessment of the range of motion of the joints near the area and particularly movement of the hip joint (Figures 203 and 204) and pubic symphysis stress tests
- Observation for discrepancy of leg length
- Evaluation of gait including if possible the individual’s specific sport activities that exacerbate the symptoms and training load
- Muscle length and strength tests (Figures 205 and 206) including adductor weakness abdominal/gluteal control and load transfer failure (Figures 207–2010)
- Palpation of the affected area

Hip joint injuries are very often overuse repetitive strain injuries and sometimes caused by trauma (Paluska 2005) The hip is very large joint that is stressed by weight-bearing movement as well as being dependent for stability on the soft tissue around it so hip injuries are common feature of many sports (Anderson et al 2001)

The hip joint is second only to the shoulder joint in terms of its range of motion Combined with the fact that the hip joint bears weight and is subjected to repetitive weight stress this makes the joint extremely susceptible to injury Persistent sports-related groin pain is frequently caused by an intra-articular hip disorder (Bohnsack et al 2006)

# The Groin in Sport

In an Australian study of elite football players Verrall et al (2007) suggested that the development of chronic groin injury may be preceded by loss of hip mobility There are several guiding tests for range and symmetry of hip movement including medial rotation (Figure 203; Verrall 2005) and the modified Thomas test (Figure 204) The Thomas test in particular can be differential indicator of hip flexor related pathology on the stretch side or hip impingement on the compression side

The most common injuries can be divided into acute and chronic accounting for approximately 5% of the cases attending sports injury clinics (Hackney 2008) The most common acute injuries are soft-tissue contusions and haematomas encountered in contact sports like football ice hockey basketball and rugby that result from direct impact but sometimes non-contact sports like gymnastics (Junge et al 2006) Acute muscle strains are commonly encountered in activities in which loaded adduction of the hip occurs like football (Ibrahim et al 2007) rugby ice hockey and breaststroke swimming or in activities where forced abduction of the hip occurs as in any sporting activity in which the sportsperson may perform split either accidentally or deliberately However there is need for consensus on acceptable study designs and methods of data analysis in sports epidemiology (Brooks and Fuller 2006)

The most common chronic conditions are strains of the muscle and tendon (Amaral 1997) Repetitive acute groin injuries may become the cause of chronic or overuse injuries (Holmich 2007) Chronic groin injuries tend to occur in those who participate in activities that promote overuse of the groin area like ice hockey skating football and running (Maffey and Emery 2007)

The iliotibial band hip flexor gluteal and adductor muscles run from the pelvis to the knee aiding hip stability Where an imbalance exists between these very strong muscle groups which are necessary to lift and propel the leg and those of the abdomen the sportsperson may experience imbalance detrimental to performance as well as being more injury susceptible (Machotka et al 2009)

Sometimes wear and tear on the hip leads to osteoarthritis (Spector et al 1996) usually in the older athlete but trauma in the younger athlete in as much as 50% can instigate increased wear early (Bradshaw et al 2008) When treatment and management of this becomes progressively less effective resurfacing of the hip an alternative to replacement has given some athletes further time in their sport

Groin injuries are found in athletes of all ages at all levels of competition They are particularly common in activities where strong and particularly repetitive adduction of the hip occurs like football skating and swimming As many as 5% of soccer-related injuries are groin injuries (Gilmore 1998) They are often result of quick lateral movements (Ziltener and Leal 2007) usually in combination with acceleration made from standing start (Johnson 1997) Football rugby and tennis are sports where there is significant incidence of this type of groin stress The least debilitating of the groin injuries is often called groin pull or strain Like other strains this is usually caused by an overstretching under load of the lower abdominal muscles or adductors particularly where hips are restricted (Ibrahim et al 2007) causing the muscle to stretch and sustain minor or worse tear A typical mild groin strain will usually resolve with rest and management over one or two weeks

The more serious groin injury is partial or complete tear of the tissue A tear will cause essential

# Physio Knowledge - Hip Pointer

# Hip Pointer

# Overview

The hip pointer can arise from both direct contusion causing impact and indirect strain injuries of the hip primarily in contact sports Forced extension of the hip for example tackle from behind in rugby may result in sprain or avulsion of the sartorius muscle at its iliac crest attachment These injuries are severely painful and make leg movement very painful taking from one to several weeks to rehabilitate depending on severity Pain may be felt when walking laughing coughing or even deep breathing Direct contusions to the anterior superior iliac crest may also involve the attachment of the sartorius muscle

# Common Sports Affected

Hip pointers are common in contact sports such as rugby and judo and proper protective equipment is essential Additionally developing appropriate skills and techniques may help avoid hip pointer Ultimately however there is not much an athlete can do to prepare for such an impact

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

- Initial routine ice treatment and compression and rule out bony injury or more significant soft tissue damage by X-ray or scan
- Medication as required including topical anti-inflammatory when the injury is superficial
- Immobilisation with crutches if necessary during the acute period which may be days or weeks
- Incremental progression to return to sport including proprioceptive mobility and strengthening exercises

# Considerations for Specific Populations

Special consideration must be given to females children and adolescents with groin pain as they may have conditions that are more serious and need medical or surgical intervention Pain in the adolescent athlete must take into consideration the susceptible growth plate in the hip Apophysitis and apophyseal fractures are more common in adolescent athletes where the growth plate may be weak link in the area Additionally children adolescents and adults may report knee pain that is actually referred from pathology in the hip which must always be considered when no knee pathology is demonstrated on examination

# Differential Diagnosis of Groin Injuries

Pain that is aggravated with activity and alleviated with rest suggests structural problem Constant pain suggests an infectious inflammatory or neoplastic (abnormal growth) process Differential diagnosis must take into consideration medical conditions that affect the groin in all individuals not just athletes:

- Referred pain from lumbar spine pathologies
- Hip joint disorders like osteoarthritis Perthes disease slipped epiphysis osteochondritis desiccans
- Intra-abdominal disorders like appendicitis
- Genitourinary abnormalities like urinary tract infections; sexually transmitted diseases

Many patients with groin pain have more than one injury often leading to managing one injury whilst second is missed and untreated Therefore the importance of comprehensive differential diagnosis is clearly justified

# Impact Injuries

Impact injuries such as those that occur during football hockey or other contact sports may result in contusions However such injuries may cause fractures of the pelvis; exacerbate previously asymptomatic inguinal hernias; and in rare cases produce bladder testicular or even urethral injuries Any patient with lower abdominal or pelvic impact injury that causes severe groin pain loss of function or blood in the urine should be immediately medically investigated If no bony injury is discovered conservative measures may be implemented

# Exercises and Guidelines for Groin Injuries

Exercises for groin injuries should follow these guidelines (Brukner and Khan 2006):

- Exercising within painful thresholds
- Isolating and reducing pelvic load sources
- Developing lumbo-pelvic stability
- Regional strengthening
- Progressing activity according to repeated assessment
- Static progressing to dynamic and finally sports specific

It is important that the sportsperson does not return too quickly to activity If they still have pain or tenderness they are liable to compensate by altering the movement pattern and technique which may result in injury to another part of the 

In study it was found that the injury rate for experienced players was five times higher than that of novice players (Emery et al 1999) In another review of ice hockey statistics revealed that adductor strains occurred 20 times more frequently during training camps rather than during the playing season (Caudill et al 2008) This may be related to the benefits of strength-training program and the fact that out-of-season lack of maintenance conditioning may contribute to groin injuries

In explosive sports the adductor tendon may fully rupture potentially pulling away from its osseous attachment and taking piece of the bone with it These are called avulsion fractures and if they cause severe displacement surgical repair may be indicated Most groin strains are mild however and eventually respond to conservative treatment Unfortunately adductor tendon pathology often coexists with other dysfunction around the pelvic region

# Classic Groin Strain or Adductor Tendinopathy

The most frequent acute strain of the groin may involve single or multiple muscles including the iliopsoas adductors and the gracilis which attach to the femur or pubis and help to stabilize the legs and flex the thigh The muscle most commonly strained and injured in the groin is the adductor longus (Harmon 2007) Other muscles that must be considered include the rectus femoris the rectus abdominis and the sartorius

Falling running changing direction kicking or doing the splits may generate these injuries Groin strains usually cause pain in the groin that radiates down the inside of the thigh more proximal than distal with pain on resisted adduction of the hip There may be confusion on occasions as MRI and ultrasound studies will often report changes at the adductor attachment when the patient is completely asymptomatic in that area

Occasionally there may be haematoma formation which can prolong the healing time The weakened area created by strain may continue to be susceptible to repeated injury for long time (Lynch and Renström 1999) In fact in review of ice hockey players those with previous groin injury had twice the risk of repeat injuries compared to athletes without previous injury (Emery and Meeuwisse 2001) Older experienced hockey players had higher injury rate

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Adductor tendon strains may be treated specifically if the symptoms are very localized and imaging is consistent with the clinical observations Soft-tissue release techniques to reduce tightness can be combined with progressive strengthening of the adductor muscles However it is very important that treatment should be accompanied by attention to any other strength or flexibility deficiencies in the pelvic area The adductors work with the gluteus medius after propulsion in running and with the hip abductors to maintain pelvic stability during the stance phase; therefore it is considered that pelvic stability prevents excessive eccentric loading of the adductors

Strain of the adductor longus should be managed depending on the location of the injury Physical examination should reveal whether the injury lies within the muscle belly or within the teno-periosteal attachment (Schilders et al 2007) Injuries to the muscle belly are best managed with strengthening gentle stretching and progressive return to activity

However avulsion injury to the teno-periosteal attachment requires more conservative management with rest until the patient is pain-free then strengthening and very careful stretching over significantly longer period of weeks; then running and sprinting; and lastly running and sprinting combined with rapid changes in direction if the sport demands it

# Physio Knowledge - Hernias and Iliopsoas Syndrome

# Hernias and Iliopsoas Syndrome

# Iliopsoas Syndrome

The iliopsoas muscle is comprised of two muscles that work together the iliacus and psoas The main function is flexion of the hip fundamental sport movement as in running and kicking In between the proximal iliopsoas tendon and the hip joint lies the psoas bursa which helps to reduce friction Iliopsoas syndrome is inflammation of the iliopsoas bursa and/or iliopsoas tendonopathy and is often found in conjunction with adductor abnormalities It more frequently occurs in sports with repetitive hip flexion like gymnastics and athletics This syndrome causes pain in the hip and upper thigh as well as hip stiffness and sometimes clicking or snapping hip Diagnosis of this condition is usually evident through manual tests but can be confirmed by an ultrasound (Deslandes et al 2008) or MRI scan (Shabshin et al 2005)

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

The condition will often settle down with ice treatment rest support and initial anti-inflammatory medication When the acute pain has diminished programme of progressive flexibility and strengthening exercises for the structures around the hip should be followed by an incremental return to full activity (Torry et al 2006) Core strengthening exercises to help improve the stability of the trunk and pelvis are an important component of the rehabilitation programme (Donatelli 2006) for this condition as it appears to be associated with hypomobility of the upper lumbar spine from which the iliopsoas originates

# Hernias

Hernias of the abdominal wall must always be considered in athletes with groin pain Hernias are frequently overlooked in the athlete with only 8% of patients with hernias being detectable on initial physical examination but 95% returning to sport after surgical repair and rehabilitation (Diesen and Pappas 2007)

The sportsman’s hernia or Gilmore’s groin was first described by OJ Gilmore in 1980 It is varied syndrome characterised by recurrent or chronic groin pain that is associated with dilated superficial inguinal ring and weakness of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal although the exact cause of this injury is considered by many clinicians to be largely speculative and could be combination of factors

The true incidence of sportsman’s hernia remains controversial; some authors (Swan and Wolcott 2007) believe it is only an obscure cause of groin pain in athletes although others (Meyers et al 2008) have now come to believe that it is the most common cause of chronic groin pain The term ‘sportsman’s hernia’ is considered by many to be misnomer as there is typically no demonstrable hernia or defect in the groin or the abdominal wall The definition of Gilmore’s groin therefore could be any condition that causes persistent unilateral pain in the groin (Brannigan et al 2000) without conventional hernia It is probably best described as severe musculo-tendinous injury or disruption of the groin which can be successfully treated by surgical repair towards the restoration of normal balanced and stable anatomy

The symptoms are pain in the groin increased by running sprinting turning and kicking After sport the athlete is commonly temporarily stiff and sore The day after game turning or getting out of bed or car often causes pain as may coughing sneezing and sit-ups There is history of specific injury in only 30% of patients

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Effective treatment for ongoing hernia is ultimately surgical repair and reinforcement of the abdominal wall In comparing the recovery times for patients after hernia repair Stoker et al (1994) and colleagues cited laparoscopic repair halved the time leading to resumption of sport participation in one week For patients with positive herniography (test for hernia)
---
# The Groin in Sport

# The Groin in Sport

# Current Understanding of Groin Injuries

There are indications that surgery results in earlier return to sport compared to exercise therapy and that laparoscopic intervention might result in an even earlier return compared with open surgery (Jansen et al 2008)

Significantly 40% of patients diagnosed with Gilmore’s Groin also have torn adductors; fact that plays an important part in the rehabilitation as minor and moderate tears usually respond to adductor exercises (Gilmore 1998) Rehabilitation should include static exercises (Figures 205 and 206) progressing to active balance and eventually multidirectional activities relating to the individual sport combined with manual therapy However patients with severe adductor tears require adductor tenotomy or release

# Diagnosis and Examination

On digital examination the superficial inguinal ring is dilated Evidence of herniation may or may not be palpable The point of most tenderness is often the ipsilateral pubic tubercle Pain can be elicited with Valsalva manoeuvre forcibly exhaling against closed airway or resisted sit-up Examination of the hip joint and evaluation of the athlete’s gait often significantly reveal weak adductors

Gilmore (1998) maintains that the success of surgery depends on accurate diagnosis meticulous repair of each element of the disruption and intensive rehabilitation according to standard rehabilitation protocol Surgery is indicated in athletes who are unable to play or fail to respond to conservative rehabilitation

# Athletes Hernia

Some believe that this condition cannot be detected by examination while others believe that careful history and examination can result in this diagnosis (Caudill et al 2008) Real-time ultrasound of the groin comparing both sides during increased intra-abdominal pressure has developed as an investigation for this condition Robinson (2002) and Diesen and Pappas (2007) maintain that the accuracy of ultrasound for detecting sports hernias is yet to be established

In patients with the possibility of several different diagnoses ultrasound can also evaluate surrounding muscles and joints In athletes with groin pain ultrasound is good initial imaging tool but MRI may be necessary for specific conditions although according to Daigeler (2007) MRI findings do not always correlate with outcomes in athletes with chronic groin pain

Some clinicians contend that anterior groin pain is result of biomechanical abnormalities rather than an anatomical weakness (Meyers et al 2007) They refer to studies like Farber and Wilckens (2007) demonstrating abnormal ultrasound findings in asymptomatic cases and pathological findings in both those that respond well to surgical treatment and those who gain no benefit

The pain is often described as variable and ongoing near the pubic tubercle maximal in the evening after exercise or on the morning afterwards and exacerbated by activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure requiring good core stability Gilmore’s groin is more common in male than female footballers (Hagglund et al 2008)

# Operative Repair

In order to rehabilitate an athlete after operative repair it is important to understand the procedure and its variables ideally with sight of the operative report

The classic operative findings (Anderson et al 2001) include laddering of the external oblique in conjunction with separation of the conjoint tendon from the ligament and laxity of the transversalis fascia Some studies such as Morelli and Weaver (2005) have suggested abnormalities with the rectus abdominis insertion avulsions of the internal oblique muscle fibers at the pubic tubercle or entrapment of the ilioinguinal or genitofemoral nerves

Conservative therapies may only temporarily alleviate patient’s pain leading to definitive later surgical procedure and management being recommended Gilmore himself repairs injuries with technique that uses six-layered reinforcement of the weakened transversalis fascia Gilmore and others (Meyers et al 2008) maintain that approximately 97% of their patients return to competitive sport by the tenth week after postoperative care and placement of supportive meshes or patches with or without neurectomy or ablation of the ilioinguinal nerve has demonstrated success

Others like Diesen and Pappas (2007) have claimed only limited surgical success and maintain that athletes who do not respond well to surgery for this condition are often subsequently provided with different diagnosis for their groin pain and need to be highly motivated in their rehabilitation However this still demonstrates the overall success of operative intervention (Farber and Wilckens 2007)

# Hip Dislocation or Fracture

week-plan 

# Hip Dislocation or Fracture

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

The surgical treatment consists of restoring normal anatomy with six-layered structural repair of the inguinal region Adductor tenotomy may be performed in order to lengthen the tissue that has developed improperly or become shortened and is resistant to stretch and is indicated in patients with persistent and troublesome adductor tears which do not respond to conservative treatment Patients are admitted on the day of operation and return home after initial physiotherapy guidance on early post-operative exercises usually within 24 hours The operation site discomfort takes approximately 8–12 weeks to settle completely

A standard rehabilitation programme is then followed which can be adjusted in the later stages to account for specific sport requirements of the individual athlete Rehabilitation exercises especially those which activate the core stability muscles are combined with pelvic control and adductor strengthening Active repetitive drills specific to the needs of the sport to make sure there are no compensatory adaptations are particularly beneficial

The successful Gilmore’s groin rehabilitation programme emphasizes the importance of activating the core stability muscles particularly transversus abdominus with multifidus

# Rehabilitation Timeline

# Week 1

First day after operation: Essential to stand upright and walk 20 mins Thereafter walk gently 4 times day Gentle stretching and core stability exercises given by physiotherapist

# Week 2

Jogging and gentle running in straight lines Gentle sit-ups with knees bent Adductor exercises Step ups

# Week 3

Increase speed to sprinting Increase sit-ups and adductor exercises Cycling Swimming (crawl)

# Week 4

Sprint Twist and turn Kick Play

# Nerve Entrapment

It is pertinent to discuss entrapment after hernia surgery as both are involved in the discussion of surgical results The nerves that have been involved require careful consideration

# Immediate Treatment

Immobilisation and immediate medical investigations with reduction preferably within few hours are critical to maximise recovery Hydrotherapy to mobilise the hip initially then to regain stability by progressive non to partial weight bearing followed by dynamic impact torsional and multi-directional weight bearing balance and strengthening exercises are very beneficial Soft tissue release techniques combined with assisted mobilising will be necessary to reduce local imbalances of laxity and tightness

# Ligamentum Teres Tear

In relatively major trauma this ligament in the hip joint can cause hip instability with ‘catching or clunking’ symptoms They can occur in sports such as gymnastics where there is extreme hip abduction

# The Groin in Sport

# The Groin in Sport

# Loose Bodies in the Hip

These are rare but may be result of cartilage pathology causing catching and locking of the hip The loose usually needs to be removed arthroscopically Recovery is steady but longer-term degenerative implications must be consideration in return to sport

# Stress Fractures

Femoral neck and the pubic ramus are the most common stress fractures in the groin region (Maffulli and Bruns 2000) Just as in many other bones in the these stress fractures are caused by repetitive trauma to the bones or through muscular attachments These stress fractures particularly occur secondary to running-related sports although additional risk factors can be intrinsic or quite diverse and include:

- Osteoporotic tendency in young female athletes secondary to nutritional or hormonal imbalances
- Changes in footwear and mode of training
- Changes in intensity and/or duration of training

Stress fractures in the groin or hip can be difficult to diagnose and treat Femoral neck stress fractures are especially troublesome because if not curtailed they may lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head which can cause long-term disability These may appear as cortical irregularity or haziness on plain X-rays but magnetic resonance image (MRI) or bone scan is usually required for definitive diagnosis

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

There must be modification of causative stress patterns rest and usually reduction of weight bearing with crutches if necessary Non-weight bearing progressing to recovery although usually complete may take several months Hydrotherapy in the early stages progressing to land-based minimal impact re-education and finally usual impact-related specific activities

# Avulsion Fractures

Groin pain from avulsion fractures of the hip must be considered particularly in young athletes who say they experienced acute sudden-onset specific pain The relative weakness of the apophysis of the adolescent skeleton predisposes the young athlete to variety of avulsion fractures Two of which are:

- Forceful movement avulsion of the anterior inferior iliac spine by rectus femoris
- Avulsion of the anterior superior iliac spine by sartorius

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Management for the majority of avulsion fractures (Koh and Dietz 2005) is usually by conservative rest and gradual incremental return to activity Depending on the size and amount of displacement of the fracture fragment the injury may sometimes need surgical repair

# Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head

This is an insidious condition that usually affects individuals between the ages of 20–40 Disruption of the circulatory supply to the femoral head either acutely or chronically results in cell ischemia and necrosis eventually damaging the hip joint Apart from well-documented systemic causes factors for its development include high loads and sudden or irregular impact as required in many sports X-rays may not show the condition for three months after

# Osteitis Pubis

rehabilitation-steps 

# Osteitis Pubis

The symphysis pubis is fibrous joint between the two halves at the front of the pelvis The adductor muscles attach either side and the abdominal muscles attach along the top of the pubic bones Therefore the symphysis is subjected to significant shearing forces especially during alternate single leg weight bearing with change of direction during activities like running and kicking (Lovell et al 2006) The shearing forces can be increased by biomechanical limitations such as restriction of internal hip rotation

Sometimes called Gracilis syndrome this is chronic pathology affecting the bone or cartilage of the pubic symphysis and relates to repetitive stress and resulting pain and tenderness from activities like kicking weightlifting running and jumping Torsional or rotational movement stressing the pubic symphysis seems to particularly aggravate and postpartum women are more susceptible (Asian and Fynes 2007) possibly due to the laxity of the pelvic ligaments during and after pregnancy

# Symptoms

Osteitis pubis causes pain in the pubic region radiating into the medial thigh of one or both sides The pain may be specifically in the thigh but is often present in the lower abdominal area There may also be associated instability at the symphysis and the athlete may be aware of clicking in the region often noticed when turning in bed Commonly pain will diminish with warm-up and be tolerable during activity

# Diagnosis

X-ray will sometimes demonstrate mottled appearance at the symphysis as result of the inflammatory process taking place in the joint Standing antero-posterior and single-leg-stance pelvic radiographs aid in the diagnosis of pelvic instability more effectively than standard radiographs of the pelvis in supine or standing antero-posterior radiograph of the pelvis alone (Siegel et al 2008) A bone scan usually shows increased uptake in the pubic bone and MRI (Kunduracioglu et al 2007) will often show edema in the bone

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Treatment of this condition is notoriously difficult (Choi et al 2008) A conservative approach to treatment of osteitis pubis is considered the first choice of action while warning the athlete that prolonged rest and prolonged absence from sport is likely However the condition may take several months to resolve which can mean difficulty with the patience of athlete and coach

Pain will often respond well to anti-inflammatory medication initially However symptoms often gradually or suddenly become more acute with pain that inhibits or stops activity becoming unresponsive to conservative management

Treatment and rehabilitation should include strengthening exercises for the core and muscles around the pelvis and lumbar spine but more importantly dealing with biomechanical influences like restricted movement of the hip joints and particularly rest from aggravating movement and activities (Wollin and Lovell 2006) All of these elements are interrelated and need to be considered in concert with each other

Injection of corticosteroid or sclerosant and surgical curettage (Radic and Annear 2008) of the joint may also be considered

# Rehabilitation Steps

1 Mobility exercise
2 Core stability exercise
3 Strength exercise
4 Balance exercise
5 Coordination exercise
6 Sport-specific exercise

# The Groin in Sport

# The Groin in Sport

# Hip Labral Tear

The labrum is lip of cartilage around the edge of the hip acetabulum which serves to deepen the socket providing added stability to the joint In jumping and kicking sports such as high jump and football there are significant repetitive stresses placed on the labrum This cumulative stress with anterior hip impingement (Noiseux and Tanzer 2008) can result in damage to the labrum causing pain restriction and sometimes clicking with hip movement particularly anterior impingement on combined flexion and adduction Some recent findings (Guevara et al 2006) suggest abnormal hip morphology may be risk factor for labral tears

The athlete will usually complain of anterior hip pain which may radiate down the anterior thigh commonly aggravated by sitting squatting or prolonged hip flexion position It has been observed (Carreira et al 2006) that 72% of athletes with labral tear reported low back pain as one of their symptoms

Examination may show decreased range of flexion abduction and internal rotation at 90° hip flexion and positive impingement and grind (compression) test Diagnosis can be confirmed on MRI and an injection of local anaesthetic into the hip area at the same time helps to confirm that MRI findings are related to the symptoms

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

There has been some limited success with tractional mobilization of especially the anterior hip structures to relieve compression using ‘seat-belt’ mobilization techniques that give the therapist more mechanical advantage over the very strong hip joint Hydrotherapy for hip stability and mobility may diminish symptoms and is certainly prudent post-operatively Modification of technique or training that directly or indirectly impinges the anterior hip is essential

Treatment in elite level athletes by arthroscopic surgery has been very successful However athletes who have undergone arthroscopy for labral tears will unfortunately frequently develop subsequent symptoms associated with an early degenerative hip joint (Murphy et al 2006)

# Synovitis of the Hip

It is important to mention that synovitis may be complication of hip pathologies However it may be primary problem especially when associated with rheumatological condition It usually responds well to rest and anti-inflammatory medication or injection

# Rehabilitation Exercises for the Groin

According to Jansen (2008) there is evidence that physical therapy aiming at strengthening and coordinating the muscles stabilizing the hip and pelvis has superior results compared with passive physical therapy Holmich et al (1999) maintains that active rehabilitation gives the athlete over 10 times the outcome possibility of returning to active sport The correct continually adapting balance between training and competition activity and recovery is critical to maximize the performance of athletes

A number of recovery sessions and modalities are now used as fundamental element of the training programmes of elite athletes to help attain this critical balance and to reduce injury potential alongside optimizing performance (Barnett 2006)

The pelvic mobility control and proprioceptive stability of the athlete are important in preventing injury but are also fundamental towards performance in sport The performance benefits of strength and conditioning exercises can be useful tool of persuasion for the therapist to convince athlete and coach of the benefits of certain seemingly pedantic exercises and drills

Single leg tests and exercises can be useful guide to the control available to the athlete in relatively static situation as compared with expectations in the much harder and spontaneous active situation of sporting activity These can take the of reduced weight bearing tests and exercise in pool (Vaile et al 2008) particularly relevant to acute early stage rehabilitation; or land-based with full weight bearing tests and exercises

# Groin Pain in Children

important 

# Groin Pain in Children

Groin pain in children warrants separate discussion as it includes situations that are rarely seen in adults; needing to take into consideration open epiphyses (Su et al 2008) in the groin region infection and developmental abnormalities

# Common Causes of Hip Pain in Children

Synovitis or inflammation of the hip joint is the most common cause of hip pain in children The hip joint is far more prone to viral inflammation in children than in adults but fortunately is usually self-limiting with rest from sport and conservative management and has no long-term effects It is important however to differentiate this condition from septic arthritis where bacterial infection can develop in the joint which is far more serious and necessitates treatment in hospital with intravenous antibiotics

# Perthes Disease

Perthes disease is disturbance in the development of the hip with the head of the femur becoming misshapen For reasons that are not fully understood the blood supply to the hip joint sometimes becomes compromised in children Properly called Legg-Calve-Perthes disease it typically affects one hip but sometimes it develops in both hips Although it can affect children of nearly any age it is most common among boys between the ages of four and eight years (Rosenfeld et al 2007)

There are many degrees of severity and of significant relevance to sport some mild cases even remain undetected until later in life particularly exacerbated by the more intensive physical stress of sport If diagnosed in childhood sporting activities will have to be modified to minimize the chance of exacerbating the condition In more severe cases surgical intervention is indicated and sporting activity has to be significantly managed (Kocher and Tucker 2006)

# Epiphysis Related Injury

This very significant and sometimes especially initially undiagnosed condition occurs particularly in sport; the epiphysis at the top of the femur moving out of position (Boardman et al 2009) It affects boys more than girls primarily between 8 and 16 years old and usually as result of repeated cumulative stress sometimes exacerbated by fall or impact trauma The pain may settle with rest but is normally accompanied by limp Less commonly limp or odd walk may be the only abnormality present and few children only complain of pain in the knee This condition constitutes medical emergency and can produce deformity in the child not diagnosed and treated promptly

One area that is commonly injured in child athletes is the attachment of Rectus Femoris to the anterior inferior iliac spine Children involved in explosive activities like sprinting jumping and kicking are at higher risk due to excessive or repetitive loading on the origin of the quadriceps The severity of the injury varies from mild strain where there is inflammation of the tendon attachment to avulsion where the growth plate is pulled off the pelvis

Most of these growth plate injuries can be treated conservatively with rest gentle very careful stretching and progressive and controlled functional strengthening (eg slow controlled squatting) However if there is significant displacement of the avulsed bony attachment surgical reattachment is required

It is important to emphasize that problems from the hip joint can present as knee pain particularly in children because of their particularly sensitive somatic radiation from the hip to the knee

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Hydrotherapy is particularly effective with children due to the novelty element of being in water doing what would otherwise be strain on short attention Exercises are used for hip mobility strength and stability as well as to regain confidence to use the limb and progress into shallower water Non-weight bearing exercises can be used on land progressing to partial weight bearing with the use of crutches and finally to full weight bearing and dynamic activity

Gait re-education is particularly important in the developing child as asymmetries that can be addressed will be magnified with growth and become habitual and subsequently permanent Proprioception and balance can also be inhibited by hip conditions in children and must also be improved as soon as possible to achieve optimum recovery Hydrotherapy and exercise in game format can be structured by the therapist to maintain the child’s interest and enthusiasm Hip arthroscopy to investigate ongoing issues may also be considered

# The Groin in Sport

# Other Causes of Groin Pain

Injuries to the groin that do not involve the bones or musculature are usually the result of direct impact Reasons to suspect these injuries are more significant include:

- Blood in the urine
- Severe abdominal pain and tenderness usually in the event of bladder injury
- Persistent nausea vomiting or abdominal distension
- Swelling in the femoral triangle or inguinal area usually in the event of hernia

All of the soft-tissue structures of the groin especially the penis testis urethra and bladder are susceptible to injury All of these symptoms merit immediate medical evaluation preferably in hospital

It should now be evident that musculoskeletal causes of groin pain can be difficult enough to differentiate from each other; however we must be aware that intra-pelvic and intra-abdominal conditions can mimic musculoskeletal groin injuries Therefore if there are any doubts referral for abdominal examination to an appropriate clinician should be part of the assessment of the athlete with groin pain

# Rehabilitation Principles

Several rehabilitation principles are paramount:

- Retraining the global muscles supporting the ‘sling’ support system
- Restoring joint mobility
- Restoring muscle extensibility
- Reducing adductor muscle strength deficits
- Training sport-specific areas of strength ie the muscle groups predominantly used
- Training relevant functional movement patterns ie relating to the characteristic techniques of the sport

# Conservative Management

Conservative management of athletic chronic groin injury results in an excellent outcome when assessed by the return to sport criterion However the results were only satisfactory if the criterion of ongoing symptoms after treatment was used More research is needed to compare the efficacy of all treatments that are used in this troublesome condition (Verrall et al 2007) Treatment should certainly be centered on the underlying cause

# Discussion

Although an athlete’s symptoms may be in the area of the groin the subjective history and objective examination in relation to the complexity of predisposing factors and specific sport often makes definitive diagnosis and prognosis uncertain A recent study by Bradshaw et al (2008) showed different breakdown of injuries in sporting population presenting with groin pain than previously reported which infers there may be diagnostic difficulties in the groin area The high incidence of hip pathology and the poor prognosis that this confers are worthy of note

It is important therefore to re-evaluate groin injury at regular intervals as its evolution as condition and response to treatment and rehabilitation may often alter the initial diagnostic and prognostic opinion

# Case Study 1

A 19-year-old rugby player developed low grade right-sided groin pain over two months Pain was aggravated by training and playing and had built up to lasting 2–4 days after activity He tried resting on two occasions for two weeks and then three weeks but pain returned on activity especially sprinting and changing direction Pain described as between 1 and 8 on 0–10 scale directly activity dependent Stairs were uncomfortable up and down Turning in bed was uncomfortable There had been feeling of tightness in the ipsilateral proximal ‘hamstring’

He had consultation with GP who referred for an X-ray which was reported as negative He had good general health

# Examination Findings

On examination:

- In standing the ipsilateral leg was medially rotated in relation to the contralateral leg
---
# Case Study 1

figures 

# Case Study 1

# Clinical Findings

- Flexion and particularly flexion adduction of the ipsilateral hip was painful in the right groin
- There was deep palpable tenderness medial to the center of line between the ASIS and the pubis
- Mild pain and restriction of passive medial rotation compared to the contralateral hip
- Mild pain with resisted adduction supine with straight legs; more pain with resisted adduction in ‘turn-out’ position
- Double leg jump asymptomatic but single leg hop discomfort

# Differential Diagnosis

- Adductor tendonopathy/periostitis/avulsion
- Nerve entrapment
- Labral tear
- Osteitis Pubis

# Initial Treatment Plan

- Rest from sport training until relatively pain free
- Static isometric specific adductor strengthening and general hip movement strengthening
- Specific and general stretching within discomfort eg bent knee turn out in crook lying
- Hydrotherapy for trunk and hip stability proprioception and controlled movement
- Hip mobility particularly medial rotation and extension
- Lying ‘clam’ exercise progressing to standing flexed knee external rotation with cliniband resistance to strengthen hip lateral rotators
- Non-impact progressing to impact and eventually controlled sport movement simulation eg jogging and passing rugby ball alternate sides

# Four Weeks Later

Tolerance to everything except change of direction which aggravated symptoms therefore gradual progression jogging to running weaving between cones wide spaced at first progressing to smaller spacing and tighter faster turns

- Ultrasound scan showed tear in the proximal adductor tendon
- X-rays of the hip/pelvis including stork views to eliminate osteitis pubis/instability were normal
- MRI to eliminate stress fracture and to visualize source of persistent pain which confirmed ultrasound scan findings

# Further Treatment Plan

- Continue with conservative treatment and rehabilitation particularly specific progressive rehabilitation exercises
- Continue activity as tolerated but should limit activities with discomfort awareness
- Using supportive reusable strapping to proximal thigh for activities

# Conclusion

There was full return to sport 5 months after the initial onset

# Discussion

- Were the number of investigations more than needed or is it necessary to rule out certain conditions?
- The practitioner athlete and coach must exhibit patience to allow recovery time More time is required to recover than is often thought to be needed
- Recognising the importance of incremental graded progressive rehabilitation is essential
- A good knowledge of functional anatomy particularly in relation to the sport is essential in differential diagnosis
- The source of pain can often be distant from the cause

# The Groin in Sport

# Case Study 2

A 24-year-old male sprinter with left-sided groin discomfort since plyometric session three months before this initial consultation had resulted in discomfort after every training session

# Symptoms

- Lower abdominal and medial anterior groin pain following activity that is becoming progressively longer to improve with rest
- Pain becomes very low grade and almost unnoticeable with rest
- Irritable pain when coughing and sneezing
- Feels ‘sore’ in the groin when sitting upright for while
- Pain in the deep inner groin when squeezing the legs together particularly in bed

Pain was described as exercise-related and variable between 1 and 7 on the 10-point scale There were minimal impingement signs with hip flexion-adduction

On inverting the scrotum and placing the little finger in both superficial inguinal rings the left side appeared more tender and dilated than the right with cough impulse

The left adductor was relatively weaker than the right and painful in resisted adduction lying with straight legs but not with legs bent in flexion There was no discomfort on stretch

Stork views of the pelvis ie X-rays of standing on one leg and then the other excluded pelvic instability pubic symphysis and hip pathology

The patient was referred to surgeon for opinion

# Surgical Findings

During surgery the following groin disruption was identified in the operative report:

- Torn external oblique aponeurosis
- The conjoined tendon was torn from the pubic tubercle
- Dehiscence between conjoined tendon and inguinal ligament

Each element of this groin disruption was repaired surgically

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Normal protocol for the first day post-operation included standing and walking with gentle stretching and stability exercises

Five days post-operative ultrasound ascertained core stability to be poor and Transversus Abdominis activation (Cowan et al 2004) was achieved with practice using patient visualization of the ultrasound real-time image for re-education

Adductor exercises were encouraged one week post-op several times per day

Closed chain exercises for stability combined with slow controlled squats progressing to single leg squats were developed two weeks post-op with hydrotherapy for flexibility and stability Swimming cycling and cross-trainer elliptical exercise developed in the third week

After four weeks he started straight line running build-ups on alternate days

# Conclusion

This athlete returned to relatively full training after two months and competed internationally six months after the surgery

# Discussion/Critical Review Questions

- At what time should an athlete with groin discomfort be referred to surgeon to consider operative intervention?
- Should longer period of conservative treatment and rehabilitation take place before referral for surgery?
- Should the patient have been referred for other investigations eg ultrasound scan or MRI?
- What other areas of the may contribute towards this athlete’s injury?

# Introduction

Exercise rehabilitation following knee joint injury can be controversial with physical rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury probably being the most debated This perspective is clearly illustrated in Table 211 which summarises the basic differences in selected international clinical research groups’ ACL-reconstruction (ACL-R) rehabilitation programmes Following ACL-R Table 211 demonstrates there is currently no consensus of opinion with regard to the use of knee brace the type of exercise performed the timing of when an exercise is introduced in the rehabilitation process the use of strength tests as objective rehabilitation progression criteria or the use of hop tests as objective outcome measures

As such this will provide rigorous evidence-based introduction to key concepts in exercise rehabilitation for ACL posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) medial collateral ligament (MCL) lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and meniscus injuries For each injury weight-bearing restrictions knee bracing recommendations and rehabilitation strength training guidelines are presented in line with very specific rehabilitation concerns concepts and exercise modifications unique to each injury type during the ‘early’ stages of rehabilitation (ie less than or equal to 12 weeks post-injury/post-surgery) when specific tissue healing time frames and the protection of surgically repaired or reconstructed injury sites may still be of significant concern

Since ideal knee and lower limb biomechanical function for high-level sports performance is then going to be the same in the ‘late’ stages of rehabilitation (ie greater than or equal to 12 weeks to 12 months) and at the point of full return-to-function regardless of the initial type of knee injury generic exercise rehabilitation guidelines for all knee ligament and meniscus injuries are then presented with reference to proprioception neuromuscular control balance deceleration plyometric and agility training

This means for example that towards the ‘late’ stages of rehabilitation it does not necessarily matter whether rugby player has sustained an injured ACL PCL or lateral meniscus – if the player wishes to return to competitive rugby the knee still has to perform in multi-directional agility-biased sport with the same frequent rapid deceleration-acceleration cycles as well as tolerating high impact forces with every foot-strike when running and jumping or as result of collisions with opponents or the ground regardless of the initial type of knee injury

As such major premise of this chapter’s overall rehabilitation philosophy is that range-of-motion (ROM) restrictions and rehabilitation strength training are critical components of the recovery process

# Quadriceps Inhibition and Muscle Atrophy

# Quadriceps Inhibition and Muscle Atrophy

# Training Modifications

Training modifications specific to unique knee injury type and its associated healing constraints are typically discontinued in less than or equal to 12 weeks post-injury or post-surgery after which all tibiofemoral soft tissue injuries can often then be guided through rehabilitation according to the same progression criteria towards the same sport-specific functional drills and goals

# Early Stage Rehabilitation

The early rehabilitation phase following injury or surgical reconstruction of the knee ligaments or menisci is initially concerned with the resolution of inflammation the reduction and removal of swelling and regaining full activation of the inhibited muscles principally the quadriceps The use of the rest ice compression elevation (RICE) principle and how it helps in the resolution of inflammation has been discussed elsewhere within this book

With all knee injuries it is critical that the injured structures are allowed time to recover from the trauma they have received as result of the initial injury or as result of any surgical intervention It is important that in all but the most minor of injuries the patient’s level of weight-bearing during gait and functional activities in the first 72 hours post-injury is ideally pain-free or at least causes minimal pain The use of crutches and partial weight bearing (PWB) is often critical to achieving this

In simplest terms if the knee-injured patient presents with any antalgic gait or ‘limp’ crutches should be used for as long as is necessary to temporarily unload and protect sensitized healing tissues Crutches should not be discontinued until patient can demonstrate full active knee extension range of motion (ROM) (ie there is no ‘quadriceps lag’)

# Knee Rehabilitation Concerns and Concepts

There are several clinical concerns and concepts regarding the safe and expedient rehabilitation of any knee-injured patient especially in the initial rehabilitation period (less than or equal to 12 weeks post-injury/post-surgery) Specific questions that address these clinical concerns and concepts include:

- How to manage quadriceps muscle atrophy and overcome its inhibition?
- Should surgical reconstruction be performed?
- Should knee brace be used during rehabilitation?
- What are the rehabilitation strength training and joint loading considerations when treating the knee-injured patient?
- Does surgical reconstruction prevent knee osteoarthrosis (OA)?

# Quadriceps Inhibition and Muscle Atrophy

Persistent quadriceps weakness is associated specifically with ACL injury but also knee injuries in general and presents major rehabilitation challenge for patients and clinicians alike Quadriceps strength deficits can still easily exceed 20% at 6 months after ACL reconstruction time when many athletes are cleared to return to activity The magnitude of quadriceps weakness can lessen with time but most research suggests that quadriceps strength deficits following knee joint injury persist for many months or years following injury or surgery illustrating the long-term nature of this problem

As the quadriceps is critical to dynamic joint stability weakness of this muscle group is related to poor functional outcomes and may contribute to the early onset of knee OA There is evidence to suggest that arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) and perhaps muscle atrophy are primarily responsible for the decrements in quadriceps strength following knee injury As such AMI in the of voluntary activation failure is hypothesized to result from reflex activity in which altered sensory information

# Mechanism of Injury and Clinical Diagnostic Tests

# Mechanism of Injury Incidence of Injury and Common Clinical Diagnostic Tests

|Injury|Mechanism of Injury|Incidence|Orthopaedic Tests|
|---|---|---|---|
|ACL|Greater than 70% ACL injuries are non-contact injuries involving ‘valgus collapse’ of the knee during the first half of stance-phase when landing from jump an abrupt deceleration when running cutting manoeuvres or pivoting manoeuvres A valgus collapse is associated with combined movements of knee flexion plus anterior tibial displacement plus internal tibial rotation plus knee valgus Contact mechanism usually involves the pivoting (into valgus/rotation) whilst the tibia is fixed|Incidence can range between 004 and 307 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures Females demonstrate 3–6 times higher incidence|Lachman's test Anterior draw test Pivot shift test|
|PCL|The mechanism of injury consistently involves high-velocity and ‘high-impact’ posteriorly-directed force applied to the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia An example would be front-on tackle to flexed knee in rugby or American football The combined movements of forced knee hyperflexion plus knee varus-valgus are also common mechanisms of injury for the PCL|Incidence of injury can range between 001 and 090 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures|Posterior Sag sign Reverse pivot shift Posterior draw test|
|MCL|Results from collision with another person Most frequently lateral blow to the distal femur or proximal tibia whilst the foot is fixed on the ground causing valgus torque to the knee and overstretching the fibres of the MCL resulting in partial or complete tear of the ligament substance|Most commonly injured knee ligament accounting for almost 30% of all knee ligament injuries approximately 31 MCL injuries per 1000 player hours|Abduction or valgus stressing of knee|
|LCL|It is quite difficult to induce an isolated acute sprain since this either requires the knee to collapse into varus in non-contact situation or for the knee to be forced into varus in contact/collision situation However isolated acute LCL sprains do occasionally occur in collision sports as result of low-velocity low-impact blow from the medial or anteromedial aspect of the knee Far more common is an LCL injury combined with simultaneous PCL or PLC knee injury due to high-impact collision in sports|Less than 2% of all knee ligament injuries even in collision sports with an incidence of less than 002 injuries per 1000 player hours|Adduction or varus stressing of knee|
|Meniscal|Traumatic meniscus injuries are usually non-contact in nature involving forced valgus in weight-bearing in turn resulting in extreme rotary compression forces through the lateral tibiofemoral joint It appears most lateral meniscus injuries are traumatic whereas most medial meniscus injuries appear to be degenerative (ie non-traumatic) Radial longitudinal vertical and complex meniscal tears are more likely the result of trauma whereas horizontal and oblique tears are typically due to degeneration|17% of all knee joint injuries sustained during competitive play with twice as many injuries to lateral meniscus|Appley’s test McMurray’s test Combined flexion adduction or extension adduction (medial meniscus) flexion abduction or extension abduction (lateral meniscus)|

1 Between 5–14 days of non-weight bearing and even bed rest immediately following surgery/injury have been recommended This is with view to controlling the inflammatory reaction and resultant joint effusion than protecting the integrity of the graft complex itself since the longer the inflammatory process and the duration of significant effusion the greater the incidence of joint stiffness severe muscle weakness and poor overall outcomes Aggressive pain and swelling control are the priorities of treatment during this timeframe (Shelbourne and Klotz 2006; Shelbourne and Rask 1998; Shelbourne et al 1992)

# Quadriceps Inhibition and Muscle Atrophy

From the injured knee joint leads to diminished motor drive to its surrounding muscles If clinicians can be effective in combating Arthrogenic Muscle Inhibition (AMI) early in the rehabilitation process they will minimize the resulting strength deficits and diminish muscle atrophy which should lead to more complete and effective rehabilitation and likely will result in quicker patient recovery and return to sport The question is how can this muscle inhibition be addressed?

# Removing Arthrogenic Muscle Inhibition

# Altering Sensory Feedback

Arthrogenic muscle inhibition can be caused by increased abnormal sensory activity due to joint effusion or by lack of normal sensory feedback due to the loss of mechanoreceptors subsequent to an ACL or other ligamentous rupture One approach to removing AMI would be blocking/modifying the sensory signals responsible for initiating the inhibitory process This might be achieved by removing abnormal sensory stimuli minimizing pain or sending signals to the central nervous system (CNS) that may modify any pre-synaptic pathways contributing to AMI

The most obvious method to reduce joint effusion is aspiration of the joint Though not without risks it has been shown to be effective in significantly reducing AMI (Fahrer et al 1988) Other modalities can also be used to reduce effusion such as compression electrical muscle stimulation and elevation but their effectiveness in reducing AMI is yet to be evaluated Application of ice has been shown to decrease nerve conductance velocity and slow the discharge of mechanoreceptors Following the application of ice quadriceps activity has been found to be facilitated (Hopkins et al 2002) Additionally Hopkins et al (2002) found that the application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) decreased AMI through the reduction of pre-synaptic inhibition Stokes et al (1985) found the effect of TENS was maximized when used while the patient exercised

# Improving Motor Drive

Rather than blocking or modifying abnormal sensory feedback an alternative approach to targeting AMI is to activate the inhibited motorneurons As AMI prevents active recruitment of the quadriceps electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) would allow for direct recruitment of motorneurons Moreover EMS has also been shown to preferentially activate type II muscle fibers compared with voluntary training of similar intensity (Binder-Macleod et al 1995) Research has also shown quadriceps EMS in combination with active quadriceps exercise has superior effect than exercise or EMS alone (Snyder-Mackler et al 1991)

Electromyography (EMG) and other forms of biofeedback may also be useful adjunct to active exercise in overcoming AMI Though the evidence is limited Maitland et al (1999) present case study showing positive findings Eccentric exercises have the potential to overload the muscle in manner greater than that of concentric exercise Gelber et al (2000) found positive results with the addition of specific eccentric exercise programmes and that by using graduated programme any issue with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was avoided

# Should Surgical Reconstruction be Performed?

When an isolated ACL injury is present there is great deal of evidence demonstrating that it is possible for an ACL-deficient (ACL-D) patient to return to high-level physical activities following sufficient exercise rehabilitation (Herrington 2004; Neuman et al 2008) However there is no single subjective or objective predictor as to whether an ACL-D patient should or should not undergo reconstructive surgery (Herrington and Fowler 2006) and the amount of anterior knee laxity measured by anterior tibial displacement does not predict whether or not patient will be able to perform high-level physical activities (Clark 2001; Herrington 2004) Therefore it seems at present the best way to decide on whether patient should undergo ACL-R surgery is whether there are persistent repetitive episodes of giving way resulting in major functional disability In other words how patient performs functionally having undergone an intensive rehabilitation period However if an ACL injury co-exists with major tear of the MCL or LCL further considerations may be necessary

# The Knee

# ACL and PCL Injuries

It is generally accepted that an ACL reconstruction (ACL-R) should be performed (Halinen et al 2006; Shelbourne and Porter 1992)

There is substantial evidence that patient who is PCL-deficient (PCL-D) can perform high-level physical activities or return to sports participation with minimal functional limitation regardless of the amount of posterior laxity present (Fontbote et al 2005; Shelbourne et al 1999) Therefore the best way to decide whether patient should undergo PCL reconstruction (PCL-R) surgery is based on persistent episodes of giving way knee pain or swelling

Consideration for PCL-R also includes the integrity of the remaining tibiofemoral capsuloligamentous structures If there is significant post-injury laxity in any of the other main tibiofemoral ligaments (ie ACL LCL MCL) or the posterior-lateral complex (PLC) or posterior-medial complex (PMC) then PCL-R is recommended (LaPrade and Wentorf 2002) A PCL-R is also recommended for the PCL-D knee if the injury has resulted in bony avulsion of either of the PCL attachments (Wilk et al 1999)

# MCL and LCL Injuries

The MCL has greater ability to heal than the other knee ligaments with excellent tensile strength and overall functional outcome even after Grade III sprain It is generally recommended that non-surgical treatment and management of acute isolated MCL injuries occurs (Halinen et al 2006) In instances where combined MCL-ACL injury exists the majority opinion is that the MCL is treated conservatively while an ACL-R is performed (Halinen et al 2006; Noyes and Barber-Westin 1995)

Although the LCL heals more slowly than the MCL Grade I and II LCL tears are treated conservatively where these injuries typically present as isolated LCL trauma (Meislin 1996) Since Grade III LCL tears rarely present without combined trauma to the PLC or PCL surgical reconstruction of the LCL and any additionally damaged adjacent capsuloligamentous structures is recommended (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2007)

# Meniscal Injuries

Surgical repair of the menisci is often recommended to relieve related symptoms restore knee kinematics to as near normal as possible and restore the patient’s function although outcomes vary considerably (Brindle et al 2001) Multiple variables influence the decision to carry out an operative repair including the patient’s age health lifestyle willingness to undergo surgery likely post-operative adherence with rehabilitation and the location of tear (Brindle et al 2001; Lee et al 2002)

Healing of the menisci is influenced by the degree of vascular penetration with only 25–30% of the menisci outer substance possessing viable blood supply (Brindle et al 2001) Consequently the middle and inner thirds of the menisci substance possess poor blood supply and are unlikely to heal easily if at all (Brindle et al 2001) The alternative to meniscal repair partial meniscectomy frequently causes altered knee kinematics and an earlier onset of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) (Lohmander et al 2007) and so meniscal repair is preferred wherever possible (Lee et al 2002) However partial meniscectomy is usually performed if the tear is in the inner one-third of the meniscus substance if the tear has major tissue fragmentation or degeneration or for tears where the edges cannot be approximated (McLaughlin and Noyes 1993)

# Use of Knee Brace During Rehabilitation

The use of knee brace following knee joint injury or surgery can depend on the type of tissue injured or the surgical procedure that has been performed (Table 213) Research demonstrates there is no significant difference in clinical or functional outcome in braced versus non-braced ACL-R patients (McDevitt et al 2004; Risberg et al 1999a) As such there appears to be no need to use knee brace after isolated ACL-R

In contrast to ACL injury routine use of knee brace after PCL injury can be essential although specific recommendations vary for the PCL-D and PCL-R knee For the PCL-D knee which is to be managed non-operatively recommendations can differ according to whether there is partial or complete tear of the PCL (Margheritini et al 2002)

Posterior shear forces begin to dramatically increase at approximately 60° knee flexion during closed kinetic chain (CKC) knee exercise such as the double-leg bodyweight (BW) squat BW wall-squat horizontal double-leg press dumbbell single-leg squat and horizontal single-leg press For the PCL-D knee with partial tear of the ligament substance it would appear sensible to wear long-leg hinged knee brace locked to allow 0–50° knee flexion for the first two weeks post-injury This will protect the healing ligament from excessive tensile loads

# Quadriceps Inhibition and Muscle Atrophy

In the early stages after injury it is important to permit functional range of motion (ROM) during gait as the posterior tibial shear forces during level walking remain at relatively low loads (Shelburne et al 2004) This ROM will also allow for selected muscle strengthening exercises The brace can then be discarded after four weeks (Margheritini et al 2002)

For the PCL-D knee with complete tear of the ligament substance long-leg hinged knee brace locked at 0° knee flexion during ambulation is considered necessary for four weeks (Harner and Hoher 1998) This is due to the injury mechanism causing complete tear of the PCL involving greater forces than those for partial tear making it likely that there will also be injury to the knee’s PLC or PMC (Margheritini et al 2002) During this time

For the PCL-R knee the patient can wear hinged knee brace locked to allow 0–50° knee flexion for the first eight weeks post-surgery The brace is limited to 50–60° knee flexion for active ROM and muscle strengthening exercises (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2007)

During single-leg stance in uninjured subjects LCL tensile forces are normally up to 85 times higher than MCL tensile forces (Shelburne et al 2005) ranging from 25% to 60% BW (Schipplein and Andriacchi 1991; Shelburne et al 2005) As such the LCL is clearly loaded far more than the MCL and so long-leg hinged knee brace is considered essential even for Grade I tears (Meislin 1996)

Following isolated MCL injury long-leg knee brace with robust medial hinge is recommended For the first week post-injury the brace is locked at 0° at rest and for gait and ADLs (Yoshiya et al 2005) being regularly unlocked for passive ROM (PROM) and active ROM (AROM) exercises up to six times per day

From week two onwards the brace can be unlocked as symptoms allow up to 90° knee flexion being discarded at three to six weeks post-injury or when 90° pain-free knee flexion is achieved and there is no quadriceps lag If an LCL-reconstruction (LCL-R) is performed with or

Without PLC-reconstruction (PLC-R) the brace is worn for at least eight weeks (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2007)

# Joint Loading Considerations in Knee Rehabilitation Strength Training

There has been commonly held belief that open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises such as the single-leg resisted knee extension (Figure 216) generate ‘excessive’ anterior tibial shear forces and ACL graft tensile loads The term ‘excessive’ refers to the concern that OKC quadriceps strength training (ie resisted knee extension) induces large anterior tibial shear forces which in turn impose large tensile forces and load on new ACL-R that are of sufficient magnitude to damage the healing graft-fixation complex (Fitzgerald 1997) Although this concern is historically grounded with the best intentions for the patient recent research demonstrates it no longer has solid foundation in clinical practice and so normal lower limb OKC and CKC muscle strength levels are illustrated in Table 214 and Table 215 respectively Between-limb differences in muscle strength should be no greater than 10% as determined by normative data obtained from uninjured subjects (Daniel et al 1982; Greenberger and Paterno 1995; Ostenberg et al 1998; Petschnig et al 1998; Sapega 1990)

Anterior tibial shear forces are considered representative of ACL tensile forces (Escamilla et al 1998) and vary considerably according to the type of exercise performed (Table 216) A resisted knee extension against load of between 2kg and 39kg generates mean peak anterior tibial shear forces of between 50 Newtons (N) (Isaac et al 2005) and 250N (Escamilla et al 1998) which is equivalent to 200–250N generated by BW forward step-up (Isaac et al 2005) It is also significantly less than the 300–410N generated by just walking (Shelburne et al 2004 2005) So based on these studies it is difficult to reconcile why many ACL-R patients are encouraged to walk and climb stairs as soon as possible post-surgery but forbidden to perform resisted knee extensions since walking actually generates higher anterior tibial shear forces (Table 216)

Furthermore as the vast majority of popular cruciate ligament reconstruction graft tissues fail at greater than 1900N (Table 217) and popular graft fixation methods for ACL-R fail at greater than or equal to 500N post-surgery (Table 218) it is also clear that the 50–250N generated by sub-maximal resisted knee extensions are of insufficient magnitude to damage properly applied graft and fixation method within correctly placed bone tunnels

With regard to the clinical application of OKC and CKC strength training after ACL-R five research groups have studied this (Bynum et al 1995; Mikkelsen et al 2000; Morrissey et al 2000; Beynnon et al 2005; Perry et al 2005a) These five clinical research studies collectively clearly demonstrate no significant difference in anterior tibial displacement between patients performing CKC-biased quadriceps strength training or mixed CKC plus OKC quadriceps strength training Furthermore ACL-R and ACL-D patients who performed the mixed CKC plus OKC quadriceps strength training programmes consistently demonstrated significantly greater quadriceps strength versus the CKC-biased strength training patients when tested at follow-up (Mikkelsen et al 2000; Tagesson et al 2008) These studies all demonstrate that the clinical application of resisted OKC knee extensions with ACL-injured patients does not cause an increase in knee laxity as defined by anterior tibial displacement

# Discussion on Tibiofemoral Shear Forces

Tibiofemoral posterior shear forces during activities of daily living (ADL) exercise and sport are frequently significantly higher than tibiofemoral anterior shear forces (Table 219) As such exercise rehabilitation for the PCL-D or PCL-R knee requires greater care and slower progression than for the ACL-injured knee This is because the normal posterior shear forces generated during physical activities are consistently of greater magnitude than the lower limits of the mean ultimate load for common PCL graft fixation methods approximated at 500N (Table 218)

Consequently there is high risk of damage to the PCL-R graft fixation site if exercise rehabilitation is progressed too aggressively or too quickly post-surgery As outlined earlier six to eight weeks is considered sufficient period for initial ‘graft protection’ since this is the time-frame currently thought necessary for minimal fixation site healing and soft-tissue graft incorporation to occur at the bone tunnel interface (Harner and Hoher 1998)

With regard to open kinetic chain (OKC) and closed kinetic chain (CKC) quadriceps strength training exercises posterior shear forces appear to rapidly increase beyond 500N at angles greater than 50–60 degrees of knee flexion (Table 219) Therefore exercises such as resisted knee extensions single-leg press and bodyweight wall squats should be limited to between 0–50 degrees of knee flexion After eight weeks knee flexion range of motion (ROM) can be progressively increased in controlled manner (Wilk et al 1999) The authors’ preferred method of cautiously increasing ROM during controlled strength training exercises following PCL-R is by 15 degrees of knee flexion per week (Table 213)

Regarding OKC hamstring strength training exercises such as the prone hamstring curl (Figure 217a) some clinicians recommend complete abstinence from such exercises for eight weeks or more after PCL-R surgery (Wilk et al 1999) This is due to the large posterior shear forces that can be generated during ‘maximum-effort’ resisted knee flexion exercises (Table 219) However because tibiofemoral posterior shear forces do not approach 500N until well beyond 20–30 degrees of knee flexion during OKC resisted knee flexion exercises (Toutoungi et al 2000) it is safe for the PCL-R patient to perform sub-maximal resisted isometric hamstring exercises within the limits of pain from 0–20 degrees of knee flexion (Figure 7b) This may deter progressive hamstring weakness secondary to the surgical trauma induced by harvesting the hamstring tendons

# Rehabilitation Strength Training

Mediolateral tibiofemoral joint shear forces during OKC and CKC rehabilitation strength training exercises are very low compared to anterior and posterior shear forces being just 5% BW for OKC quadriceps exercise (Kaufman et al 1991) and 12% BW for double-leg squats (Hattin et al 1989) Since frontal plane knee alignment should be relatively neutral during these dynamic rehabilitation exercises with very little valgus rotation of the tibiofemoral joint such exercises are clearly safe for all MCL injuries when performed within the limits of pain

During standing single-leg CKC exercise LCL tensile forces dramatically increase from 60% BW in uninjured subjects up to 88% in knee injured patients (Schipplein and Andriacchi 1991; Shelburne et al 2005) This is because it is normal for the lateral femoral condyle to ‘lift-off’ the lateral tibial plateau so that more compressive load is borne through the joint

# Does Surgical Reconstruction Prevent Knee OA?

Surgical reconstruction of torn ACL has frequently been recommended with the intention of delaying or preventing the onset of tibiofemoral OA To date it is clear that an ACL-R does not protect the knee from developing OA (Myklebust and Bahr 2005; Roos 2005; Keays et al 2007; Lohmander et al 2007) As such following technically proficient ACL-R appropriate and sufficient exercise rehabilitation is essential

# The Knee - Rehabilitation Concepts

# The Knee

# Generic Knee Rehabilitation Concepts

# Basic Concepts

Knee and lower limb biomechanics have been extensively studied with regard to running jumping hopping and leaping in sports (Hewett et al 1996; Decker et al 2002; Lewek et al 2002; McLean et al 2004; Fontbote et al 2005; Noyes et al 2005; Paterno et al 2007; Ortiz et al 2008) For all injured knees to perform safely and effectively in these activities without re-injury they should eventually be able to perform the same necessary range of motion (ROM) and tolerate the same inherent joint compression and shear forces typical to such high-velocity high-impact movement patterns

Although different types of knee injury can have very different weight-bearing ROM and rehabilitation strength training restrictions in the early stages of exercise rehabilitation (eg less than or equal to 12 weeks post-injury/post-surgery) all types of knee injury should eventually be progressed to tolerate the same approximate joint compression and shear forces natural to running jumping hopping and leaping in sports in the late stages of rehabilitation (eg greater than or equal to 12 weeks to 12 months post-injury/surgery)

# Effects of Proximal Muscles on Knee Function and Injury

# Basic Concepts

It is well established that lumbo-pelvic-hip complex frontal plane alignment can have powerful effect on whole lower limb alignment particularly knee alignment in the frontal and transverse planes (Powers 2003) Weakness in the lateral flexor and gluteal muscles has been related to excessive knee valgus and poor frontal plane alignment during single-leg closed kinetic chain (CKC) tasks (Willson et al 2006; Jacobs et al 2007) Additionally it has been statistically proven that impaired trunk and gluteal muscle function can significantly impact knee function

# Effects of Proximal Muscles on Knee Function and Injury

# Effects of Proximal Muscles on Knee Function and Injury

Muscle function is consistently linked to non-contact knee injury (Nadler et al 2000; Zazulak et al 2007) Moreover Bobbert and Van Zandwijk (1999) have demonstrated how increased gluteal muscle function directly enhances both quadriceps and hamstring muscle function during dynamic closed kinetic chain (CKC) tasks Therefore generic exercises for all tibiofemoral joint injuries should include strength training for the trunk lateral flexors gluteus maximus and gluteus medius

# Trunk Lateral Flexors

The trunk lateral flexors have profound effect on maintaining pelvic alignment in the frontal plane (Neumann 2002) and weakness and dysfunction in these muscle groups predicts non-contact knee injury (Zazulak et al 2007) An excellent exercise to specifically target these muscle groups is the isometric side-bridge in standing (Figure 218) which can later be progressed to side-laying (Figure 219) As an exercise this can be performed using 10 repetitions per set for up to eight seconds each to avoid the effects of cumulative ischemia over multiple repetitions (McGill 2007) In testing normal mean total holding times are greater than or equal to 80 seconds for each side (McGill et al 1999)

# Gluteus Maximus

The gluteus maximus has the ability to limit excessive hip adduction and internal rotation of the femur (Neumann 2002) also playing crucial role in preventing lower limb flexion collapse in single-leg stance (Liu et al 2006) Unilateral weakness of the gluteus maximus is linked to the eventual onset of lower limb injury and low back pain (LBP) (Nadler et al 2000) and so exercises for this muscle group should also be included in all knee rehabilitation programs Effective exercises for the gluteus maximus include prone isometric setting (Figure 2110) eventually progressing to straight-leg hip extension in four-point kneeling (Ekstrom et al 2007) This exercise can be performed using 10 repetitions per set for up to eight seconds each to avoid the effects of cumulative ischemia over multiple repetitions (McGill 2007)

# Gluteus Medius

The gluteus medius is critical for both controlling frontal plane alignment of the pelvis on the femur

# The Knee

According to Neumann (2002) the gluteus maximus plays crucial role in controlling knee valgus by limiting excessive femoral adduction and internal rotation (Powers 2003) Valgus collapse of the knee is associated with traumatic non-contact injuries to the ACL MCL and lateral meniscus (Boden et al 2000; Hewett et al 2005) as well as non-traumatic gradual onset knee joint pain (Powers 2003; Leetun et al 2004) Therefore exercises targeting this muscle are vital in knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programs

Effective exercises for the gluteus maximus include:

- Side-lying hip abduction plus external rotation in less than or equal to 45° hip flexion with the feet supported (see Figure 2111)
- Side-lying straight-leg hip abduction (Ekstrom et al 2007; Distefano et al 2009)

# Models and Levels of Sensorimotor Control

Motor control is defined as “the control of both movement and posture” (Shumway-Cook and Woollacott 1995) There are at least nine models of motor control most of which operate on ‘sensory-motor’ basis This indicates that effective motor output requires accurate sensory highlighting the critical need for normal proprioceptive feedback to the CNS Mechanoreceptor feedback modifies motor output at all three levels of the CNS: the spinal cord brainstem and cerebral cortex (Ghez 1991a 1991b)

# Proprioception

Proprioception has often been poorly defined and confused with other sensorimotor functions such as balance (Riemann and Lephart 2002a 2002b) It is correctly defined as the sense of position and movement of the joints and limbs which corresponds to static joint position sense (JPS) and kinaesthesia respectively (Martin and Jessell 1991) Several studies have identified impaired JPS and kinaesthesia in patients with ACL injuries (Borsa et al 1997 1998; Roberts et al 1999) PCL injuries (Safran et al 1999) and meniscal injuries (Jerosch et al 1996)

Given these findings it is clinically useful to identify exercise training methods that can enhance peripheral joint proprioception The muscle spindle is the most potent proprioceptor which is always stimulated with active movements due to alpha-gamma coactivation (Gordon and Ghez 1991)

Neuromuscular control refers to any aspect of CNS control of muscle to function as dynamic restraint and stress shield of inert tissues with the specific aim of maintaining functional joint stability (FJS) (Riemann and Lephart 2002a 200b) In other words neuromuscular control is the active restraint of excessive joint motion and the coordinated dampening of joint loads in response to specific sensory feedback (Riemann and Lephart 2002a 2002b) and can be classified into acute and learned neuromuscular control (Clark 2008)

Strength training alone does not consistently modify potentially dangerous whole lower limb and local knee joint kinematics or kinetics (Herman et al 2008) As such neuromuscular control is an important concept since different exercise training methods induce different physiological and biomechanical adaptations that comprise its separate components This is another major premise of this chapter – different training methods induce different adaptations and so comprehensive injury prevention or injury rehabilitation programme must be composed of several different types of exercise in order to thoroughly encompass all the different components of neuromuscular control Neuromuscular control can be considered as the motor component of sensorimotor control

# Acute Neuromuscular Control

Acute neuromuscular control is an almost instantaneous motor response to ‘at-that-moment-in-time’ sensory information about sudden joint displacements and is composed of the electromechanical delay (EMD) and the rate-of-force development (RFD) The EMD is the timeframe between the onset of reflex muscle electrical activity and the onset of measurable force development (Winter and Brooks 1991) The RFD is the timeframe between the onset of measurable force development and the achievement of specific quantity of force (eg 25% 1RM) (Kaneko et al 2002)

Relatively shorter EMD and RFD timeframes equate to faster reactive muscle activity which is clearly desirable when resisting sudden potentially dangerous knee joint displacements To date there is no convincing evidence that the EMD can be shortened with training whereas the knee muscle RFD can be significantly shortened with OKC and CKC strength training (Hakkinen and Komi 1983 1986; Hakkinen et al 1998; Aagaard et al 2002; Bruhn et al 2004) as well as balance training (Bruhn et al 2004; Gruber and Gollhofer 2004; Ihara and Nakayama 1986) and agility training (Wojtys and Huston 1996) Therefore selection of different training methods can enhance knee acute neuromuscular control in the of faster reactive muscle activity

# Learned Neuromuscular Control

Where acute neuromuscular control refers to reactive muscle activity at single point-in-time learned neuromuscular control refers to how the CNS uses repeated sensory feedback generated within multiple training sessions to induce long-term training adaptations that include joint-protective motor programmes and more favourable knee and lower limb kinematics and kinetics

Learned neuromuscular control includes decreased vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) decreased knee joint reaction force (JRF) decreased knee joint shear forces decreased knee abduction (valgus) forces improved frontal plane hip-knee-ankle alignment increased hip-knee-ankle flexion improved hamstring:quadriceps (H:Q) ratios improved feed-forward pre-impact muscle activation and improved postural stability All of these components contribute to improved whole lower limb alignment and decreased knee joint forces during highly dynamic tasks and so are highly desirable for knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes

Increased VGRF during the loading response phase of landing tasks results in increased

# The Knee - Physiotherapy Knowledge

# The Knee

# Training Methods for Knee Injury Prevention

Training methods that have been shown to reduce vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) and knee joint shear and compression forces include:

- Warm-up + dynamic stretches
- Plyometrics
- Deceleration drills
- Balance drills
- Closed kinetic chain strength training
- Open kinetic chain strength training
- No-impact cardiovascular training + aerobic cool-down
- Isolated trunk muscle exercises
- Passive stretches

# Injury Risk Factors

Increased knee abduction forces during landing tasks are associated with:

- Increased valgus hip-knee-ankle frontal plane alignment
- Reduced hip-knee-ankle sagittal plane flexion

These factors place the ACL MCL and lateral meniscus at high risk of injury during rapid loading responses in deceleration maneuvers

# Gender Differences in Knee Injuries

Research indicates that female athletes experience greater relative number of knee injuries compared to males This trend is also observed in:

- Low back pain (LBP)
- Foot ankle and lower leg injuries

Factors contributing to this increased risk in females include:

- Less knee muscle strength
- Lower proprioceptive acuity
- Lower reflex gluteal activation levels after foot-strike in landing tasks
- Higher VGRF
- Higher knee anterior shear forces
- Higher knee abduction forces
- Increased knee valgus alignment during deceleration maneuvers

# Summary

Comprehensive knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programs should ideally include variety of training methods such as strength training balance training deceleration training and plyometric training These methods can significantly improve neuromuscular control variables associated with knee injury risk

# Balance and Perturbation Training

# Proposed Knee Exercise Rehabilitation Pathway

The existence of knee exercise rehabilitation pathway (Figure 2113) where rehabilitation is progressed in such way that the complexity of exercise is progressed once sufficient strength training base has been established would appear possible especially since many different training methods induce different favorable proprioception and neuromuscular control training adaptations (Clark 2008)

# Basic Concepts

For the purposes of this chapter balance training refers to single-leg closed kinetic chain (CKC) training performed on exercise devices that function as an unstable base-of-support (BOS) Such devices include for example rocker-boards (Figure 2114) wobble-boards foam rollers inflatable equipment (Figure 2115) and mini trampolines The clinician can obviously use any other method deemed useful for creating an unstable BOS

The patient should be encouraged to maintain optimal pelvis-hip-knee-ankle alignment during balance training (Figure 2115) The authors cue patients to this effect by instructing them to keep the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) as level as possible and to keep the tibial tuberosity between the first and third toes At no time should the tibial tubercle deviate inside the first toe indicating valgus collapse of the knee and whole lower limb (Figure 2115)

Perturbation training refers to orchestrated training situations where the clinician attempts to deliberately unbalance the patient by rhythmically tapping and knocking the balance device itself pushing and pulling the patient at the shoulder or pelvic girdles (ie rhythmic stabilizations) or by distracting the patient with ball tosses (Figure 2116) Since this type of training does not include impact forces it seems sensible to become proficient in this method of training before introducing high-impact exercise drills (eg plyometrics)

# Clinical Considerations

In an injury rehabilitation context even though females consistently demonstrate greater impairment in proprioception and neuromuscular control variables than males the principles underlying female exercise rehabilitation progression can essentially be the same as for males However comparatively speaking since females may well be starting their knee exercise rehabilitation at relatively ‘lower’ proprioception and neuromuscular control ‘baseline’ than males female knee rehabilitation and return to full function may then take longer than the time required for males

Specific clinical criteria will be outlined in more detail later Such conditions ensure the patient is progressed through rehabilitation as safely and effectively as possible according to their own unique individual ability and so goals of treatment also function as progression-criteria (Clark 2004 2008) When implementing the pathway in Figure 2113 it is important to remember that as the patient progresses and new exercise type is added to single training session each new exercise type ‘builds’ on the type that preceded it so that the patient is always performing all the previous exercise types for the remaining rehabilitation process

# Entry Criteria

Since the intent of balance training is to perform single-leg closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises on an unstable base of support (BOS) for multi-planar training it seems appropriate to ensure patients can maintain optimal knee and whole lower limb alignment on stable BOS As such patients should ideally demonstrate the ability to perform:

Three sets of 15 repetitions of single-leg squat to ≥ 45° knee flexion on the ground on both legs

This should be achieved before progressing from one balance training device to another

# Methods

Patients can begin balance training using rocker-board or foam roller to deliberately cause frontal plane varus-valgus oscillation of the knee progressing to round-base balance device for perturbation and distraction training The progression includes:

Using rocker-board or foam roller for initial training
Progressing to round-base balance device for multi-planar balance training
Eventually moving to impact training (eg deceleration/plyometric drills)

# Goals of Treatment and Objective Progression Criteria

The minimal goal of treatment for this type of training should be to perform:

Three sets of 15 repetitions of single-leg squat to ≥ 45° knee flexion on both legs on round-base device (ie multi-planar balance training)

# The Knee - Deceleration Training

# The Knee

# Deceleration Training

# Basic Concepts

Deceleration training refers to exercise drills intended to teach correct landing technique for running jumping hopping and leaping activities in sports and high-level occupational tasks Such training uses exercises designed to decelerate the momentum of the lower limb and trunk following foot-strike and the onset of impact forces emphasizing eccentric-biased muscle control of sagittal plane knee and lower limb joint flexion followed by isometric-biased muscle activity to stabilize the knee lower limb and trunk

# Entry Criteria

Since deceleration training involves high shear forces as well as high vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) ideal entry criteria are modified from Clark (2001 2004 2006) and include:

- Normal muscle strength values outlined in Table 214 and Table 215
- Trunk and gluteal muscle function recommendations described earlier in this chapter
- Three sets of 15 repetitions of single-leg squat to greater than or equal to 45° knee flexion on round-base balance device

At first glance this may seem like high number of criteria; however many of these should already have been achieved much earlier in the rehabilitation process Such criteria are necessary to ensure the safest and most effective introduction possible of the high joint shear and compression forces inherent in high-impact training

# Methods

Deceleration training sessions must be supervised by clinician competent in such training techniques and able to use visual verbal and tactile teaching methods Training sessions should never take place on concrete; yielding surfaces are most suitable (eg dance studio sports hall grass etc) (Chu 1998)

Patients are initially taught the biomechanically correct and functionally stable final landing alignment where:

- The head is up and eyes looking forwards
- The trunk is inclined forwards approximately 30°
- The shoulders are over the knees
- The knees are over the mid- to rear-foot
- The hands are in the ‘athletic ready’ position

In the frontal plane the center of the hip knee and ankle joints are aligned optimally

LSI (%) = (Weight pushed by injured limb (kg) / Weight pushed by uninjured limb (kg)) × 100

The tibial tubercle should be positioned approximately in straight line between the first and third toes (Figure 2120) and the tips of the toes and heels should also align in straight line (Figure 2119) (Chu 1998; Hewett et al 1996 1999; Noyes et al 2005)

On landing the foot-strike should ideally roll from the ball of the foot to the heel followed by distal-to-proximal flexion of the ankle knee and hip joints finishing with greater than or equal to 45° knee flexion There should be minimal forward-backward or side-to-side unsteadiness of the pelvis or overt muscle tremor (Chu 1998; Hewett et al 1996 1999; Kovacs et al 1999; Noyes et al 2005)

Patients should be instructed to land as softly as possible (Devita and Skelly 1992; Zhang et al 2000) and the moment of landing should be as quiet as possible (Onate et al 2001 2005; Prapavessis et al 2003) It is entirely normal to demonstrate degree of knee varus-valgus oscillation (ie ‘wobbling’) following landing The key concept is to control the amount of varus-valgus oscillation that occurs (Clark 2006) This can be achieved by verbally cueing the patient not to allow the tibial tubercle to deviate inside the first toe/metatarsal

Alignment for single-leg deceleration drills should not differ greatly from that for double-leg drills However the trunk and pelvis must move slightly laterally to the foot to maintain the ’s center of mass over its base of support (BOS) which is the foot

# The Knee

# Deceleration Training

Once the eccentric phase has been completed patients should maintain the ideal landing position (Figures 2119 and 2120) for three to five seconds If the patient loses balance the ideal landing position should be reassumed for three to five seconds to provide the CNS with ‘memory’ of the correct versus incorrect final position The intensity of deceleration drill can be influenced by increasing distance or height covered with recommended 80–100 total foot-contacts per training session for an uninjured beginner (Chu 1998) and 40–50 foot-contacts for initial injury rehabilitation

A within-session work:rest ratio of 1:5–1:10 is advised and there should be no more than three training sessions per week separated by at least 48 hours between each session (Chu 1998) Signs of fatigue include loss of ideal frontal plane alignment decreased sagittal plane joint flexion increased frequency of loss-of-balance muscle tremor and louder landings at which point the drills should be stopped due to risk of new or re-injury The clinician should be extremely vigilant for symptoms of pain and signs of swelling redness or heat which all signal that deceleration training should be terminated immediately pending reassessment of the patient’s injury site

# Goals of Treatment and Objective Progression Criteria

The minimal goal of treatment for this type of training should be to perform three sets of 10–15 repetitions of single-leg drills on both legs with correct technique before progressing to plyometric training It is possible for skillful patient to achieve this goal within one training session

# Plyometric Training

# Basic Concepts

Plyometric training is progression from deceleration training and involves the ballistic three-phase stretch-shortening cycle of eccentric-isometric-concentric muscle actions (Chu 1998) The isometric muscle action is the transition phase between the eccentric and concentric phase being termed the ‘amortisation phase’ and this phase should be as short as possible in order to avoid the elastic energy stored within the muscle’s connective tissues being lost as heat (Chu 1998)

Historically plyometric training has been classified using an ascending system of intensity from least intense to most intense including jumps/hop-in-place standing jumps/hops multiple jumps/hops bounding box drills and finally depth jumps (Chu 1998) Although this classification system has been used for decades with uninjured athletes in performance enhancement and injury prevention context (Chu 1998; Hewett et al 1996 1999) it is built from empirical observations rather than quantifiable forces (eg VGRF) (Clark 2006) and is difficult to transfer to an injury rehabilitation context since the ascension through the different classes of plyometric drill can be quite sudden with regard to the anticipated dramatic increase in VGRF and tissue loads (Clark 2006)

In view of this clinical concern Clark (2006) proposed different classification and progression of plyometric drills termed ‘Clinical Plyometrics’ (Figure 2121) for more refined clinical application in an injury rehabilitation context The ascending complexity of clinical plyometrics drills was based simply on best rank ordering of joint shear forces (Table 2110) and VGRF (Table 2111) drawn from wide variety of published research – the higher the forces the more intense the drill with regard to the magnitude of tissue loads (Clark 2006) as well as the notion that some types of drill naturally generate higher knee abduction forces (valgus moments) than others (Sell et al 2006)

Thus the rank ordering of drills (Figure 2121) was based on the anticipated tissue loading characteristics of specific drill defined by the magnitude of shear and compression forces as well as knee valgus moments (Clark 2006) This is because for example increased VGRF results in increased knee joint shear forces (McNair and Marshall 1994; Yu et al 2006; Sell et al 2007) and increased local JRF (Enoka 2002) whilst transverse plane knee motion induces greater ACL tensile loads than sagittal plane knee motion (Markolf et al 1995)

In-place drills predominantly load the tibiofemoral joint along its longitudinal axis and induce relatively low compression JRF (Clark 2006) Examples of in-place drills are up-and-down

# Drills and Forces

On-the-spot jumps and hops such as squat jumps tuck jumps and vertical hops are common exercises Saggital plane drills introduce greater antero-posterior shear forces (Clark 2006) Examples of saggital plane drills include forward jumps and forward hops Form skipping involves typical low-impact drills usually employed for practicing running mechanics and technique (eg skipping high knee lift) and is means of reintroducing running-like movements with low impact forces (Johnson et al 2005)

Frontal plane drills introduce larger mediolateral loads varus-valgus forces VGRF and anterior tibial shear forces than saggital plane drills (Sell et al 2006) and also potentially increase tensile forces on the cruciate and collateral ligaments (Clark 2006) Examples of frontal plane drills include side-to-side jumps and hops Once frontal plane drills have safely been completed saggital plane running (jogging) can be undertaken over relatively short distances Running itself even at low speeds is plyometric activity that induces joint shear forces (Table 2110) and VGRF (Table 2111) Consequently it is clinically judicious to only introduce running after some other of deceleration and plyometric training has been performed first in order to prepare the patient’s tissues and sensorimotor control systems since running can be relatively ‘uncontrolled’ compared to structured deceleration and plyometric drills (Clark 2006)

Oblique plane drills introduce greater torsion forces through the knee although they are relatively low amplitude rotational loads compared to other plyometric drills (Clark 2006) Even so when knee combined movements such as flexion and internal rotation and anterior tibial shear are added together greater ACL tensile forces are generated than in any single movement in isolation (Markolf et al 1995) Examples of oblique plane drills include zig-zag jumps and hops

# Agility-Biased Running Drills

# Agility-Biased Running Drills

# Transverse Plane Drills

Transverse plane drills introduce relatively high amplitude rotational loads and are potentially very dangerous for the knee ligaments and menisci (Clark 2006) Examples of transverse plane drills include:

- 180° and 360° on-the-spot spinning jumps
- Single-leg hopping drills

These drills carry major risk of knee and lower limb high velocity varus–valgus collapse if the patient is not extremely cautious and proficient in their performance

# Depth Jumps and Hops

Depth jumps and hops induce some of the largest joint shear forces and vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) (see Tables 2110 and 2111) These are high-risk drills that must be performed with meticulous technique to minimize the risk of re-injury (Clark 2006) Examples include:

- Single-leg drop-landing drills from 40cm high box

# Entry Criteria

Entry criteria for clinical plyometrics can be the same as for deceleration training along with the successful completion of three sets of 10–15 repetitions of the chosen plyometric drill as deceleration drill first The patient should master the drill’s landing phase before converting it to plyometric drill

# Methods

The methods described for deceleration training underpin the safe and effective execution of clinical plyometrics Clinical plyometrics differ from deceleration drills in that after the eccentric-isometric muscle action sequence concentric propulsive phase is added The patient is encouraged to take off as fast as possible after landing (Clark 2006) Verbal cues to teach rapid take-off include:

- “Tough ‘n’ go”
- “Quick feet”
- “Fast feet” (Chu 1998)

Intensity within-session work:rest ratio weekly frequency and between-session rest duration for clinical plyometrics are identical to those for deceleration training Saggital plane frontal plane and oblique plane drills can also be implemented using cones or barriers for patients to jump or hop over

# Goals of Treatment and Objective Progression Criteria

Ideal goals of treatment for this type of training include the successful execution of timed agility tests specific to the athlete’s sport within the drills’ normal timed standard The clinician should research sport-specific coaching texts for the appropriate normal values A specific goal of treatment is three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions of single-leg drills on both legs

# The Knee - Functional Performance Tests

# The Knee

# Functional Performance Tests

# Entry Criteria

Prior to discharge best clinical practice recommends the administration of the hop functional performance test (FPT) to gather objective outcome measurement data (Clark 2001; Fitzgerald et al 2001) Therefore hop FPTs generate valuable information for the clinician regarding knee-injured athlete’s physical and psychological status

Outcome measurement in sports rehabilitation is directed at identifying an athlete’s ability to tolerate the physical demands inherent in sport-specific activity and prevent re-injury on return-to-competition (Clark 2001) The FPT recreates the knee shear compression and torsion forces encountered during sport-specific activity under controlled clinical conditions Its use has become increasingly popular since traditional clinical outcome measures such as knee joint laxity and isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength demonstrate weak to moderate and often insignificant relationships with functional tasks such as running and jumping (Clark 2001; Fitzgerald et al 2001)

Functional performance tests include hop leap and jump tests and may be administered to an athlete following knee ligament injury (Clark 2001) The administration of an FPT to knee-injured patient is considered essential before deciding if discharge is appropriate and many clinical and research groups employ FPTs as objective outcome measures (see Table 211)

# Methods

With regard to choice of FPT there is good evidence that multi-directional hop FPTs such as the adapted crossover hop for distance (Figure 2122) as presented by Clark et al (2002) are more sensitive to detecting between-limb differences in knee function than uni-directional FPTs such as the single hop-for-distance (Clark 2001; Noyes et al 1991) This is because multi-directional hop FPTs are considered most challenging for patients since they impose frontal and transverse plane forces on the knee in addition to the sagittal plane-biased forces generated by most horizontal hop FPTs (Clark 2001 2002)

# Discharge Criteria

A mean Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) greater than or equal to 90% (Figure 2118) is well established as the normal value for hop testing (Daniel et al 1982; Ostenberg et al 1998) Moreover mean LSI greater than or equal to 90% is consistently demonstrated following multi-directional hop tests in asymptomatic ligament-injured knees where patients are regularly participating in high-level sports or occupational activities without functional limitation (Eastlack et al 1999; Hopper et al 2002)

Assuming the uninjured limb is achieving normal values an LSI greater than or equal to 90% can be considered an ideal discharge criterion providing that all hop FPT entry criteria as described previously are also fulfilled

# Anterior Knee Pain: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

# Anterior Knee Pain: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

# Anterior Knee Pain

Anterior knee pain (AKP) is common clinical entity in patients of all ages and activity levels The category of conditions placed within the grouping AKP could be defined as involving pain inflammation muscle imbalance and/or instability of any component of the extensor mechanism of the knee This disturbance of the extensor mechanism of the knee has been regarded as one of the commonest disorders of the knee affecting between 5–15% of all patients reporting for treatment (Devereaux and Lachmann 1984; Kannus et al 1987; Milgrom et al 1991) Once present it frequently becomes chronic problem forcing the patient to stop sport and other activities

# Differential Diagnosis

The classification of symptoms into AKP is confusing with AKP being present in many clinical conditions The commonest clinical conditions which have symptoms of AKP are:

- Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)
- Patella tendonopathy
- Fat pad syndrome
- Traction apophysitis (Osgood Schlatter/Sinding Larsen Johansson disease)
- Plica syndrome
- Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBS)
- Nerve entrapment

Taunton et al (2002) in retrospective review of sports medicine clinic patient’s found AKP to be 292% of all running injuries which is very similar to the 28% Clement et al (1981) found two decades earlier Of the AKP patients found in the study of Taunton et al (2002) 565% had PFPS 288% ITBS and 164% patella tendonopathy

For treatment of AKP to be successful appropriate rehabilitation programmes need to be established These can only be developed if accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause of the AKP is recognised It is the purpose of this to describe the common clinical conditions which present with AKP how to ascertain their differential diagnosis and their own particular management The list below shows the commonest clinical problems which can present as AKP

# Potential Causes of Anterior Knee Pain

- Patellofemoral joint
- Patella tendon (patella tendonopathy)
- Iliotibial band (Iliotibial band friction syndrome)
- Fat pad (fat pad syndrome)
- Plica (plica syndrome)
- Traction apophysitis (Osgood Schlatters disease Sinding Larsen Johanson disease)
- Referred pain from lumbar spine sacroiliac joint or hip joint

# Distinguishing Differences on Examination

Table 2112 shows the distinguishing differences on examination between the most common causes of AKP: PFPS patella tendonopathy ITBS and fat pad syndrome With careful examination it becomes relatively easy to distinguish between these different causes of AKP which is important as each of these conditions requires very specific interventions

|Condition|Key Examination Findings|
|---|---|
|Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS)|Patellar compression pain pain with squatting stairs or prolonged sitting|
|Patella Tendonopathy|Localized pain at the inferior pole of the patella tenderness on palpation|
|Iliotibial Band Friction Syndrome (ITBS)|Pain over the lateral aspect of the knee positive Ober's test|
|Fat Pad Syndrome|Localized pain below the patella tenderness on palpation of the fat pad|

# Additional Causes of Anterior Knee Pain (AKP)

The list above highlights that alongside the major causes of AKP number of others occur with some regularity and are worth discussing briefly here A common cause of AKP in adolescents is traction apophysitis (Osgood Schlatters/Sinding Larsen Johansson disease) These two conditions occur when excessive loading has been placed through the growth plates at the tibial tubercle in the case of Osgood Schlatters disease and the inferior pole of the patella (Sinding Larsen Johansson disease); this results in inflammation and pain In both cases the patients have usually recently undergone or are in the middle of growth spurt The pain is activity-related often showing linear relationship; the greater the activity the greater the pain and pain is localized to the respective growth plates being very painful on palpation Treatment here is simply to reduce the level of loading on these tissues to one which the patient can tolerate and then gradually re-introduce loading to the tissues over period which may extend into number of months Secondary factors such as soft tissue length and muscle strength imbalances may also need addressing

The entrapment of two peripheral nerves has been reported as potential causes of AKP within the literature: the lateral cutaneous nerve and the infra-patella branch of the saphenous nerve Problems with the lateral cutaneous nerve are often mistaken for ITBS as the pain is on the lateral side of the knee often following the course of the Iliotibial band However this pain is most often superior to the lateral femoral condyle even though it is irritated by similar actions as ITBS; the pain the patients describe is often shooting and burning in nature which allows further differentiation The infra-patella branch of the saphenous nerve most often gives patients pain that shoots from medial (around the vastus medialis area) across the infra-patella area of the knee to the lateral side Injury to this nerve is most often associated with trauma or through surgery (ACL or arthroscopy) damaging or irritating the nerve It has also been seen in ballet dancers who in failing to achieve full turnout excessively externally rotate and abduct the tibia stressing the nerve

AKP may also be referred from the lumbar spine sacroiliac or hip joints Whenever assessing patient with AKP it is essential to consider these potential sources of pain

# Anterior Knee Pain: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

# Anterior Knee Pain: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

In assessing patient with Anterior Knee Pain (AKP) it is vital to screen other joints to determine if they are involved This is especially important if the patient reports pain in those areas or describes the pain as "going up from the knee or coming down to the knee" Additionally if the patient reports numbness or altered sensation in and around the anterior medial or lateral thigh further investigation is warranted

# Causes of Altered Loading

Numerous structures can become injured and cause AKP Regardless of the specific structure that becomes injured one common feature is that the injury is caused by an overloading of the tissue which can be either acute (usually traumatic) or chronic (long-term low loads that eventually cause tissue breakdown often referred to as “dripping tap effect”) The categories of potential causes of tissue stress include:

- Abnormal biomechanics
- Shortened soft tissue
- Muscle imbalances and strength deficits
- Training/environmental factors

# Abnormal Biomechanics

Understanding the Q angle (see Figure 2123) and its effect on patellofemoral joint (PFJ) loading is crucial for understanding how abnormal biomechanics affects the PFJ The Q angle represents the force vector (direction of pull) of the quadriceps during contraction If the quadriceps causes the patella to be drawn medially or laterally from its normal course during contraction this can potentially increase the stress and loading on the PFJ and associated structures Decreasing the Q angle by 10 degrees significantly reduces load on the lateral structures of the PFJ (Elias et al 2004)

The Q angle can be affected by both soft tissue tightness and muscle weakness as well as mal-alignment within the lower limb such as anteriorly rotated pelvis or foot pronation If the foot over-pronates (the longitudinal arch of the foot flattens) it will cause excessive internal rotation of the leg leading to the knee pointing inwards and altering the Q angle Anterior pelvic rotation can make one leg appear longer prompting the to compensate often by excessively flattening (pronating) the foot of the longer leg to shorten it thus changing the Q angle

# Shortened Soft Tissues

A variety of shortened soft tissues can influence the Q angle At the hip shortened hip flexors (such as rectus femoris iliopsoas and iliotibial band) can hold the pelvis in an anteriorly rotated position If the adductor muscles (particularly adductor longus) are short this can cause the femur to be held in an internally rotated and adducted position increasing the Q angle A short iliotibial band (ITB) can cause the tibia to be held in an externally rotated position moving the tibial tubercle laterally and altering the Q angle Additionally if the gastrocnemius or soleus (triceps surae complex) are short this limits the ability to dorsiflex at the ankle To compensate for this lack of movement the foot may excessively pronate

# Muscle Imbalances and Strength Deficits

In the research into Anterior Knee Pain (AKP) considerable attention has been paid to achieving increased activity and strength in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle with the aim of drawing the patella medially against the pull of the laterally attached vastus lateralis The problem is that the majority of the literature has failed to find either problems with VMO in patients with AKP or means of specifically training VMO in isolation (Herrington et al 2006) What is consistent in the literature is that patients with AKP have weak quadriceps as whole (Witvrouw et al 2002) with number of studies showing successful resolution of symptoms upon strengthening of the quadriceps (Witvrouw et al 2002; Herrington and Al-Shehri 2007) A second group of muscles whose weakness is consistently reported within the literature to be associated with AKP are the gluteal muscles (gluteus maximus medius and minimus) (Mascal et al 2003) Weakness of these muscles causes the thigh to drop into more adducted and internally rotated position during weight bearing which increases the Q angle and loading on the Patellofemoral Joint (PFJ)

# Training or Environmental Triggers

All of the above problems can be found in many members of the public and yet they do not have AKP What these predisposing factors need is trigger that affects the tissue in negative way reducing its tolerance to loading There are many potential triggers to this change in tissue load tolerance One example would be direct trauma from blow or surgery Another example would be the change in loading brought about by new training shoes or boots or change of training surface A further example is too rapid increase in loading following period of de-training (decreased loading of the tissues leading to loss of tolerance) caused by illness or even holiday

# Treatment

The aims of treatment are:

- Relief of pain
- Control of lower limb rotation
- Strengthening of quadriceps
- Stretching of shortened soft tissues

# Relief of Pain

Taping of the patella (Figures 2125a and 2125b) has consistently been shown to relieve pain (see Aminaka and Gribble (2005) for review) The mechanism by which taping brings about the relief of pain has often been questioned but it appears to bring about enough of change in local tissue loading to alter tissue homeostasis (Dye 2005) Figure 2125a shows taping of the patella medially to change loading on the medial and lateral sides of the PFJ Figure 2125b shows an alternate method of taping the patella to correct the lateral tilt Figure 2125c shows the taping used to relieve loading on the infra-patella fat pad Relief of pain could also be achieved through the use of joint mobilisation Figure 2126 shows

# Strengthening Techniques

Strengthening of the quadriceps has been shown in number of papers to bring about improvements in Anterior Knee Pain (AKP) (Witvrouw et al 2002; Herrington and Al-Shehri 2007) These authors have also demonstrated that the mode of strengthening does not appear to be important Previously both open kinetic chain exercises such as seated knee extension and closed kinetic chain exercises such as leg press or squatting have been advocated as being individually better for AKP

# Rehabilitation Techniques for Anterior Knee Pain (AKP)

When rehabilitating AKP patients it has been observed that progressive loading during exercise is more important than the mode of exercise itself (Herrington and Al-Shehri 2007) Studies by Witvrouw et al (2002) and Herrington and Al-Shehri (2007) demonstrated significant improvements in function and pain relief within 6–8 weeks of starting strengthening program A key feature of both programs was the constant reassessment and adjustment of load on the quadriceps rather than the specifics of the exercise program

# Incline Squat

A specific and highly useful variation of the squat exercise for patients with patella tendonopathy is the incline squat (Jonasson and Alfredson 2005) This exercise is initially performed bilaterally and can be progressed to unilateral squatting as pain permits

# Modification for Fat Pad Syndrome

Due to the lack of control in the final degrees of extension in patients with fat pad syndrome the squat exercise can be modified to improve control of extension as shown in Figure 2128

# Stretching of Shortened Soft Tissues

As mentioned previously several tissues may become shortened altering the loading on the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) by changing the Q angle Figures 2129–2132 illustrate techniques for stretching the following muscles:

- Rectus Femoris
- IT Band (Iliotibial Band)
- Adductor Longus
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus

The key to these stretching exercises is that one end of the muscle (either the origin or the insertion) is fixed while the other end moves This allows the stretch to be isolated to the respective muscle and prevents compensatory movements at other joints

# Control of Lower Limb Rotation

Failure to control lower limb rotation is very much associated with increasing the Q angle (Figure 2123) As mentioned above strengthening of the gluteal muscles could improve this pattern of movement by decreasing the adduction and internal rotation of the femur during loading

# Summary

Knee joint exercise rehabilitation can be complex and controversial task with regard to weight-bearing and ROM restrictions tissue biomechanics between-limb and within-limb compensations evidence-based progression criteria the restoration of normal gait and therapists’ and surgeons’ opinions regarding specific injury type This chapter has presented comprehensive meticulously clinically reasoned and evidence-based approach to the rehabilitation of different types of knee ligament and meniscus injury or surgery including normative data for different testing procedures to be used as goals of treatment and objective progression criteria The use of such data frees the clinician from the uncertainty associated with tissue healing timeframes and outdated personal opinions frequently expressed by colleagues by accounting for the individual patient’s ability and unique physiological status It is the safest and most effective way to administer exercise rehabilitation for tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint injury

# Epidemiology

Ankle injuries are one of the most common injuries seen by the sports medicine clinician accounting for up to 30% of all sports injuries (Fong et al 2007) Volleyball reports ankle injuries as 44% (Agel et al 2007b) basketball 25% (Agel Olsen et al 2007a) and soccer 23% (Nelson et al 2007) of all injuries The lateral ligaments are primarily implicated in these injuries with the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATFL) being particularly susceptible to damage Woods et al (2003) reported that 73% of ankle injuries in English football involved ATFL trauma Moreover sprains to the lateral ligaments of the ankle are responsible for more time lost from sports participation than any other injury (Hertel 2006) While the vast majority of injuries to the ankle involve the lateral ligament complex an accurate diagnosis taking into account all structures must be made in order to ensure that the appropriate management and rehabilitation is instituted

This chapter will begin by giving brief outline of the anatomy and biomechanics of the sporting ankle before discussing in greater detail clinical assessment and rehabilitation principles of ankle injuries We will look at acute ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability as well as some of the other pathologies that are found in the region

# Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics of the Sporting Ankle

Functionally the ankle complex is composed of three joints:

1 The talo-crural joint (TCJ – between the talus and the inferior aspect of the tibia)
2 The inferior tibiofibular joint (ITFJ – between the distal ends of the tibia and the fibula)
3 The subtalar joint (STJ – between the talus and the calcaneus)

While it is certainly possible to damage one of these joints in isolation and it is true to say that the TCJ is implicated in the majority of lateral ankle sprains (Hertel 2002) concomitant STJ sprains may be present in as many as 80% of people presenting to sports medicine clinics with lateral ankle sprain (Meyer et al 1986) This behoves us to become adept at assessing all the structures in the ankle

# Stability of the Ankle Complex

The bony architecture of the ankle is partially responsible for joint stability but only in certain situations The medial and lateral malleoli provide certain degree of side-to-side stability and in full weight

In weight-bearing position all ligaments are in relaxed state making the congruency of the talo-crural joint crucial The ankle is least stable in plantarflexion (the loose packed position) which is why this position is most commonly implicated in acute ankle injuries

Several ligaments provide support to the ankle complex The major ones are listed in Table 221 and illustrated in Figures 223 and 224

Dynamic stability of the ankle complex is provided by the peroneal muscle group particularly the peroneus brevis and longus These muscles have an anticipatory action preparing the ankle to accept weight at foot strike (Konradsen and Hojsgaard 1993) The loss of the pre-emptive function of the peroneals is thought to be one of the sequelae of Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) leading to the foot accepting load in more plantarflexed and inverted position The load-to-failure point of the peroneal tendons is believed to be greater than that of the Anterior Talofibular Ligament (ATFL) and equal to the Calcaneofibular Ligament (CFL) (Attarian et al 1985)

# History of Acute Injury

# Mechanisms of Ankle Injury

As with all injury assessments determining the mechanism of injury and the position of the ankle at the time of injury is particularly important for deducing the injured structures The most commonly reported method of spraining the lateral ligaments occurs when the ankle is "rolled" into plantarflexion and inversion (Wolfe et al 2001) This is frequent occurrence in sports such as when landing from jump onto an opponent's shoe in basketball or when reaching for wide backhand volley in tennis

In these situations forefoot contact often precedes calcaneal contact leading to plantarflexion moment on the talus which thrusts its narrow between the malleoli exposing the lateral ligaments to stretching force that may exceed their tensile strength (Ritchie 2001) While it is possible to sustain an isolated CFL injury it is infrequent This may occur in incidents involving inversion in dorsiflexion or external rotation when fully weight-bearing This mechanism may also injure the syndesmosis or the talar dome A combined ATFL and CFL injury is said to occur in 20% of ankle sprain cases (Brostrom 1964)

Posterior Talofibular Ligament (PTFL) injuries are usually found in severely injured ankles where both the ATFL and CFL have also been injured An isolated PTFL lesion is exceptional The sequence of ligament rupture under inversion stresses is as follows:

- ATFL → Anterolateral capsule (resulting in the ecchymosis commonly seen with an ankle sprain)

# Ankle Ligaments

|Name|Origin|Insertion|Action|Interesting Facts|Implications for Rehabilitation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Anterior Taloﬁbular Ligament (ATFL)|Distal end of the fibula|Neck of the talus|Limits excessive plantar flexion and inversion as well as anterior movement of the foot in relation to the leg|Intracapsular but the weakest of the lateral ankle ligaments and most frequently injured Blends with the joint capsule|Following an ankle sprain the ATFL needs to be protected from both inversion and inversion|
|Calcaneoﬁbular Ligament (CFL)|Distal end of the fibula|Upper lateral aspect of the calcaneus|Helps to limit inversion particularly during weight bearing|The CFL is cord-like and is the largest lateral ligament|Needs to be rehabilitated in plantar grade ankle position and in weight bearing|
|Posterior Taloﬁbular Ligament (PTFL)|Distal end of the fibula|Lateral tubercle of the posterior fossa of the talus|Taught only in end of range dorsiflexion|The strongest and deepest of the lateral ligaments Isolated rupture of the PTFL rarely is implicated in ankle instability|If this is injured check for damage to other structures because it does not lead to ankle instability|
|Inferior Tibiofibular Ligaments|Distal tibia|Distal fibula shaft and malleolus|Talar stabilization|Consists of anterior and posterior parts (posterior is significantly stronger) The ITFL together with the interosseous ligament forms the syndesmosis|Can be assessed with the talar tilt test and may require immobilization in walking boot to allow repair|
|Cervical Ligament|Superior aspect of the calcaneus|Inferior surface of the talus|Helps restrain ankle inversion|Acts with the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament and is frequently injured in ATFL strains but missed in assessment causing rotary instability if injured| |

# History of Acute Injury

It is also possible to injure the deltoid ligament on the medial side of the ankle when the weight of the is forced over an everted foot Given the high forces that are required to do this however the injury is infrequent and lateral malleolus fracture or syndesmosis injury should be excluded in this instance

- CFL
- PTFL

Should the inversion stress continue the ankle complex may dislocate or fracture (Safran et al 1999)

# Onset of Pain

The most important thing to exclude in an acute ankle injury is the presence of fracture It is for this reason that the Ottawa Ankle Rules were formed (see below) It is possible for an athlete to sustain an ankle ligament sprain and not notice it at the time (particularly in combat or collision sport where there may be strong stress-induced analgesia response) although it is more common for any injury to be accompanied by immediate pain An ankle fracture will almost invariably not allow the athlete to put any weight on it at all whereas sprain may allow weight bearing but may get worse as it is continued The athlete may recall ‘pop’ or ‘crack’ at the time of injury but not too much importance should be placed on these sensations as they do not necessarily relate to the extent of injury

# Area of Pain

Determining the area of pain can be particularly helpful when determining the injured structure because many of the ligaments are quite superficial and can therefore be located with ease It is often useful to ask the athlete to “point with one finger” where it is most painful The most frequent area for pain is around the antero-lateral ankle The medial aspect of the ankle may be painful if there was an eversion force that injured the medial ligament complex although it is also not uncommon for it to be painful following an inversion injury if there was some medial joint compression causing some bone bruising The pain from syndesmosis and talar dome injuries tends to be more centrally located deeper and more diffuse Ankle fractures tend to be exquisitely painful on palpation The most common sites of ankle fractures are the distal fibula and the 5th metatarsal These sites should be carefully examined (see the Ottawa Ankle Rules below) Whilst the site extent and intensity of pain swelling and bruising can be useful early indicator of the location and extent of damage injury severity is more reliably judged by the degree of

# Disability Following the Incident

Assessment of disability following the incident includes evaluating how much the ankle can be actively moved and whether weight bearing is possible

# Radiographic Investigations and the Ottawa Ankle Rules

In the majority of cases imaging of the acutely injured ankle is not necessary as it does not alter the management of the athlete However there are key exceptions primarily concerning the need to exclude an ankle fracture In 1992 the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) were published providing clinicians with guidance on referring an injured ankle for radiographic investigation (Stiell et al 1992) According to these rules an X-ray of an injured ankle is only necessary in patients with:

- Pain along the posterior edge of the distal 6 cm of the fibula (including the tip of the malleolus); or
- An inability to walk more than four steps either immediately or at subsequent closer assessment within 10 days; or
- Pain at the base of the 5th metatarsal

If the patient presents with any of these signs they should be referred for an X-ray with anteroposterior (AP) lateral and mortise views In the mortise view the talus should be equidistant between the malleoli before syndesmosis disruption can be excluded (Lynch 2002) The implementation of the OAR has resulted in dramatic reduction in the number of X-rays taken without reduction in the detection of ankle fractures (Leddy et al 1998)

Other investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) computerized tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) are typically unnecessary in the acutely injured ankle because they usually do not change clinical management which is primarily based on symptoms However they may be helpful in excluding an osteochondral lesion/talar dome fracture If the athlete’s progress is not as swift as expected these imaging techniques may be employed CT is best for imaging osteochondral injuries while US is preferred for imaging tendon pathology (Shalabi et al 2007) US imaging is gaining popularity due to its ability to provide dynamic imaging of the foot and ankle particularly the soft tissues For example it allows visualization of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sliding around the medial malleolus and through the fibro-osseous tunnel as the ankle moves through its range of motion in the sagittal plane This interaction enables the athlete to demonstrate the movement and the stage of the movement that provokes their pain which is particularly useful for functional rather than just anatomical or structural pathology At this stage MRI and CT scans are still limited to static imaging

# Physical Examination

Like every joint the ankle should be examined in sequence Table 222 details the specific areas to be examined

# Stress Tests

Manual stress tests are often used in the clinical setting to determine the type and extent of ankle ligament injury The two most common stress tests used for the ankle are the talar tilt test and the anterior draw test

# Anterior Draw Test

This test assesses the anterior translation of the talus with respect to the tibia It is best performed with the patient sitting up with their legs over the edge of the bed to relax the gastrocnemius The tibia is stabilized with one hand while the other hand grasps the talus and draws it forward in the sagittal plane A positive test is indicated by greater anterior displacement of the foot with respect to the lower leg compared to the uninjured side It has been stated that sagittal plane displacement of greater than 3 mm is indicative of an ATFL lesion (Anderson et al 1952) However like many manual stress tests the results remain largely subjective and should be used as guide only This test can also frequently provide false negative results if there is guarding of the ankle due to pain or thickened fat pad at the posterior calcaneal tuberosity (Johnson and Markolf 1983)

|Test|Purpose of Test/Looking For|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Observation|Swelling bruising deformations alterations in weight bearing|Performed in supine standing and walking if able|
|Active and Resisted Movements|Range of motion quantity and location of pain|Examine PF DF inversion eversion heel raise|
|Passive Movements|Range of motion quantity and location of pain end feel|Examine PF DF inversion and eversion plus overpressure|
|Stress Tests|Examines integrity of ligaments Looking for amount of ROM and pain|Compare to the opposite side|
|Functional Tests|Examines the ability of the ankle to cope with integrated tasks such as walking running changing directions jumping and hopping|Compare to the opposite side if appropriate and look for antalgic movement patterns|
|Palpation|Specific tenderness and swelling|Palpate each structure (see Table 223) to see if it hurts rather than touch where it hurts and then try to determine the structure|

# Talar Tilt Test

The talar tilt (TT) test is used to assess anterolateral rotation of the ankle joint movement that is normally restrained by combination of the ATFL and the CFL The TT test is performed with the ankle in slight plantarflexion the tibia and fibula held stable The calcaneus and talus are grasped with the other hand and “tilted” into inversion This is then compared to the uninjured side with talar tilt of greater than 15 degrees when compared to the uninjured side has been correlated with dual ATFL and CFL strain (Gaebler et al 1997) although there is wide range of values for both injured and uninjured ankles reported in the literature which makes interpretation difficult (Frost and Amendola 1999)

The current consensus of opinion is steered towards functional non-operative treatment irrespective of the amount of ligamentous laxity demonstrated on stress testing As consequence the treatment of the injured ankle is contingent on the functional status of the ankle and so the exact degree of ligamentous laxity may indeed be moot

# Palpation of Structures

Palpation of the ankle after an injury can be especially useful when trying to localize an injury to specific structure

# On Field Assessment of the Injured Ankle

The key thing to note is the position of the ankle at the point of injury If the ankle was in fully weight-bearing position when it was rolled the chances are there is more extensive damage and the player is unlikely to be able to continue playing It is important to check the uninjured ankle to determine what is “normal” and thus comparison of end feel can be made more authoritatively If the player has an immediate effusion or bruising and/or is unable to weight bear they should be removed from the field If the decision is made to allow the player to continue playing they should be observed to ensure that they are able to run freely change directions and decelerate rapidly If they cannot perform these tasks there is likelihood of more serious injury and they should be taken from the field for more thorough assessment and immediate management

# Table 223: Order of Palpation

|Structure|Location|
|---|---|
|Distal fibula|Along the posterior edge of the fibula from 6cm above the tip of the fibula If there is marked tenderness the athlete should be referred for an X-ray to exclude fracture|
|Tip of the lateral malleolus|At the furthermost tip of the fibula to help determine the presence of an avulsion fracture|
|ATFL|From the lateral malleolus down to the talar neck (best done in plantarflexion and inversion)|
|CFL|From the lateral malleolus vertically down to the calcaneus (best done in inversion)|
|PTFL|From the back of the lateral malleolus across to the posterior midline|
|Peroneal tendons|Posterior to the lateral malleolus to the base of the 5th metatarsal (peroneus brevis) and underneath the foot to the medial cuneiform and great toe (peroneus longus)|
|Base of 5th metatarsal|Lateral aspect of the 5th metatarsal base to assess for avulsion of the peroneus brevis|
|Deltoid ligament|In fan shape extending down from the medial malleolus to the navicular sustentaculum tali and talus|
|Sustentaculum tali|A bony ridge inferior and slightly anterior to the distal end of the medial malleolus|
|Sinus tarsi|A ‘cavity’ or tunnel located anterior and inferior to the lateral malleolus leading to the subtalar joint|
|Anterior tibiotalar joint line|Best assessed with the ankle at rest in plantarflexion|
|Talar dome|Slightly inferior to the tibial plafond when the foot is plantar flexed to 45 degrees|
|Anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament|Anterior border of the distal fibula shaft obliquely up to the tibia to assess for the ‘high ankle sprain’|
|Flexor hallucis longus tendon|Posterior to the medial malleolus and it courses down through the talus’ fibro-osseous tunnel|
|Posterior ankle recess|Posterior ankle between the malleoli and deep to the Achilles tendon Palpate from the calcaneus up to the talus|

A good habit to get into is to systematically palpate structures in order and see if this elicits pain This is better and more reliable than going straight for where it is sore and then working backwards to deduce exactly what it is that is sore underneath your finger This will help minimize injured structures not being detected The order of palpation should be as shown in Table 223

An on-pitch assessment may need to be limited to range of motion (ROM) couple of stress tests and ability to weight bear In clinical setting however full assessment should be conducted in order to be more diagnostically precise

# Grading of Ankle Ligament Injury Severity

Grading an injury to the lateral ankle ligaments remains controversial topic because by-and-large grading scales are subjective and hard to validate The three main scales used to grade severity are listed below:

1 Grading based on the number of ligaments injured (ie 1 2 or 3 ligament injury) The downfall of this method is that it does not assess to what extent each ligament is injured
2 Traditional grading based on the extent of structural damage A grade I injury exhibits microscopic unfurling of the crimped pattern of the ligament without any macroscopic damage A grade II injury has macroscopic stretching without ligament rupture A grade III injury is complete rupture The downfall of this method is that

# Other Causes of Anterior Ankle Pain

# Other Causes of Anterior Ankle Pain

# Clinical Judgement Grading

In this method grade I injury is assessed as involving no or minimal functional loss no extra joint ROM little or no pain swelling or bruising A grade II injury is where the patient’s ankle ROM is reduced although accessory movement testing reveals extra joint movement but firm end-feel moderate pain over the injured ligament swelling and bruising A grade III injury implies complete rupture where there is no longer an end-feel on accessory movement testing overall joint motion is markedly reduced there is marked swelling and bruising and function has been lost

# Syndesmosis Strains

The ankle syndesmosis is composed of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) and the interosseous membrane The mechanism of injury is forced external rotation of the weight-bearing foot or forced plantarflexion such as rolling over the front of the ankle Injuries to the syndesmosis have historically been underdiagnosed and are significant source of chronic ankle pain in the athlete

Like other ankle ligament sprains injuries to the syndesmosis are often graded in terms of amount of damage sustained:

- Grade I: AITFL stretch
- Grade II: AITFL partial tear
- Grade III: Complete AITFL rupture (O’Donoghue 1984)

The AITFL is tender on palpation particularly when it is stressed with the external rotation stress test For this test the athlete is seated with their legs overhanging the couch hips and knees flexed to 90 degrees The lower limb is stabilized with one hand whilst the other hand dorsiflexes and externally rotates the foot

A grade I-II injury should be immobilized in walking boot until pain-free (typically up to 2 weeks) and needs to be followed by progressive active rehabilitation programme A weight-bearing X-ray that demonstrates widening of the mortise may require surgical opinion with view to internal fixation Following surgical fixation of grade III syndesmosis strain an athlete may be back to athletic competition in around six weeks following progressive rehabilitation programme (Taylor et al 2007)

# Anterior Impingement

Anterior impingement occurs when either anteriorly located hypertrophied soft tissue bony exostosis on the talus or tibia or loose limits tibio-talar dorsiflexion The athlete complains of persistent pain at the front of the ankle particularly when lunging It is also commonly seen in football in the non-dominant kicking leg It may be caused by repeated loading at the extremes of dorsiflexion as seen in football or ballet It is often seen after lateral ankle sprain where there may be arthrokinematic changes that limit the posterior glide of the talus in the mortise (Hubbard and Hertel 2006)

There may be tenderness on palpation of the anterior joint line and in advanced cases it may be possible to feel bony spur Manual therapy to restore normal accessory talus motion and anti-inflammatory medications/modalities are often helpful and period of rest from loaded dorsiflexion activities is recommended Tape can be applied to limit the extent of talo-crural dorsiflexion

# Sinus Tarsi Syndrome

The sinus tarsi is small tunnel that is located near the talar neck and the calcaneus at the antero-lateral aspect of the ankle slightly antero-inferior to the lateral malleolus The sinus tarsi is densely packed with synovial tissue that is easily inflamed In the majority of cases the athlete will have history of at least one ankle sprain and present complaining of diffuse pain slightly below and anterior to the ATFL (Oloff et al 2001)

They may describe pain when walking on uneven ground jumping or hopping to the side of the injury landing from jump or running off-line Manual therapy of the subtalar joint can be very effective and whilst frequently the athlete will receive great benefit from corticosteroid injection into the sinus proprioceptive strength and biomechanical rehabilitation programme is imperative to correct the underlying causes of the pathology

# Osteochondral Lesions of the Talar Dome

Osteochondral defects (OCD) of the talar dome are commonly thought to be due to impact of the talar dome as it shears across the tibial plafond as either single trauma or as result of repetitive plantarflexion plus inversion ankle sprains
---
# Ankle Complex Injuries in Sport

# Talar Dome Injuries

The chondral surface can be diagnosed at the time of injury but in many cases they are diagnosis of exclusion as the athlete complains of recalcitrant deep and diffuse anterior ankle pain that despite appropriate conservative rehabilitation lasts much longer than would be expected for “normal” ankle sprain Talar dome injuries can be tested clinically by palpating the talar dome (best located just distal to the tibial plafond when the ankle is plantar flexed) They are best diagnosed with an MRI scan (Mosher 2006) but CT scanning may be required as an adjunct to determine the extent of the chondral surface damage Depending on the extent of the lesion surgical stabilization may be necessary after which comprehensive and extensive rehabilitation program is required to respond to eccentric loading (Alfredson and Cook 2007)

# Iselin's Disease

Iselin’s disease is traction apophysitis of the peroneus brevis at its attachment onto the base of the 5th metatarsal It is found in adolescents particularly those with prominent 5th metatarsal who participate in sports that require sudden changes in direction such as football lacrosse and cross-country running Treatment for Iselin’s disease is always conservative and may involve rest from provocative activities anti-inflammatory interventions and medications followed by progressive rehabilitation program

# Lateral Ankle Pain

# Peroneal Tendinopathy

Peroneal tendinopathy is usually an overuse injury and is one of the most common causes of non-traumatic lateral ankle pain The athlete will usually present with an insidious onset of lateral ankle pain often located either posterior to the lateral malleolus or at the base of the 5th metatarsal

A retrospective review of 40 patients who underwent peroneal tendon repair for peroneal tendon tears demonstrated that the peroneus brevis was by far the most commonly implicated tendon (88% of cases) with the rest being made up of peroneus longus tears In 37% of cases there was combined brevis and longus tear The average age of the patient was 42 years and the most commonly reported mechanism of injury was lateral ankle sprain (Dombek et al 2003) These findings are consistent with those reported by Saxena and Cassidy (2003)

Treatment of peroneal tendinopathy will depend on whether the pathology is acute and proliferative or chronic and degenerative Both will require period of rest from aggravating activities and biomechanical correction with footwear analysis and potentially orthotic insertion Soft tissue therapy is useful to reduce muscle tone in the peroneals and gastro-soleus complex but there is some evidence to suggest that aggressive stretching of pathological tendon is not advisable Strengthening of the peroneals is vital in both the acute and degenerative condition; however the more chronic the situation the more likely it is

# Posterior Ankle Pain

# Posterior Ankle Impingement Syndrome (PAI)

The posterior aspect of the ankle is common site of pain in athletes who participate in activities that require extremes of talo-crural plantar flexion such as taekwondo ballet running and football PAI is labeled as “syndrome” because it is an umbrella term used to describe pain anywhere in the posterior region of the ankle joint There are however number of factors that can contribute to this condition The athlete will commonly report pain upon plantar flexion particularly if it is forced PAI can arise from overuse or trauma

The structures in this area of the ankle that can be compressed and thus cause pain include:

- Os trigonum (an unfused part of the back of the talus present in 10–15% of the population)
- Thickened posterior joint capsule or PTFL
- Enlarged posterior talar process or distal tibial osteophyte
- Posterior joint synovitis
- Flexor hallucis longus tendon (Lee et al 2008a)

In the overuse scenario repeated forced plantar flexion (such as kicking in martial arts downhill running or standing “en pointe” in ballet) gradually increases

# Medial Ankle Pain

# Medial Ankle Pain

# Overview

The normal range of motion of the talo-crural joint is plantarflexion which reduces the “clearance distance” between the talus and the tibia at the end of range If this space is further compromised by any or combination of factors compressive pathology may result

Traumatic hyperplantarflexion can result in fracture of the posterior talar process or traumatic posterior joint synovitis Post-traumatic calcification of the joint capsule can occur as late consequence of plantarflexion plus inversion ankle sprain

The athlete will usually describe pain at the back of the ankle that they confuse with the Achilles tendon Palpation of the Achilles tendon is usually unremarkable although palpation of the posterior aspect of the talus will usually reproduce their pain The pain is usually aggravated by forced plantarflexion

In the painful position medial glide on the calcaneus will usually compress the medial structures and lateral glide will compress the lateral structures helping to differentially diagnose between posteromedial and posterolateral impingement

Rehabilitation should address any contributory talo-crural midfoot and subtalar joint hypomobility hypertonic or tight FHL triceps surae and peroneals and improving calf muscle and intrinsic muscle endurance This is in addition to correcting any biomechanical/alignment issues A posterior recess steroid injection will often be required followed by 7–10 days of avoidance of plantarflexed positions Occasionally surgical excision of any structural abnormalities/loose bodies may be required (Lee et al 2008b)

# Deltoid Ligament Sprain

The most commonly reported mechanism of injury to the deltoid ligament occurs when the athlete has their foot planted on the ground in pronated position and then falls outward placing large abduction force on the ligament (Lynch 2002) Given the amount of force required to injure the deltoid ligament there is high probability of injury to associated structures For this reason it is reasonable to expect rehabilitation to be much lengthier process than for lateral ankle sprain although the principles of injury management are very similar

# Flexor Hallucis Longus Pathology

FHL tenosynovitis is an important cause of posteromedial ankle pain It is particularly common in ballet dancers and kicking athletes due to the extraordinary range of motion that the tendon must travel from fully dorsiflexed position to fully plantarflexed one The athlete will often complain of posterior ankle pain on landing from jump or when striking kick/ball impact

It can be differentially diagnosed by medially gliding the calcaneus whilst in end range talo-crural plantarflexion Also passive extension of the great toe whilst the patient is in weight-bearing lunge position will draw the tendon or thickened and low muscle belly through the fibro-osseous tunnel of the talus reproducing their pain This is often referred to as stenosing tenosynovitis (Hamilton et al 1996)

A steroid injection may be useful in the short term to reduce any inflammatory component but the athlete will also need assessment and rehabilitation of any biomechanical abnormalities when they are in plantarflexed position Frequently if the calcaneus is abducted (known as ‘sickling out’) when heel raise is performed compression of the FHL will occur and re-education of this movement is required Should conservative measures fail surgical intervention may be required

# Tibialis Posterior Pathology

Tibialis posterior tendon injury is classically an entity of overuse and is characterized by medial ankle pain that may track down to its insertion on the navicular tubercle (although it also has distal attachments onto the cuboid all three cuneiforms the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament and the 2nd and 4th metatarsals)

The function of the tibialis posterior is to invert the subtalar and midfoot joints and to help stabilize the medial longitudinal arch It can become subjected to an overuse injury in the athlete with excessive subtalar joint pronation but is also susceptible to direct trauma Resisted inversion will often be weak and painful and the tendon may be painful on palpation

MRI or USS is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and rehabilitation usually involves rest anti-inflammatory modalities (particularly if traumatic incident) eccentric strengthening and biomechanical correction (often involving tape or podiatric involvement)

# Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome

The tarsal tunnel is fibro-osseous tunnel formed by the flexor retinaculum as it arises from the medial malleolus and attaches to the medial aspect of the calcaneus and onto part of the abductor hallucis longus fascia Tarsal tunnel syndrome is painful condition involving entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel and is characterized by burning pain in the toes plantar aspect of the foot or around the tarsal tunnel itself which is worsened by load-bearing (Kinoshita et al 2006) Occasionally there may be positive Tinel’s sign but may also require nerve conduction studies and/or MRI Conservative treatment involves rest orthotic or tape intervention to reduce excessive subtalar joint (STJ) pronation and sometimes steroid injection Should it fail to resolve surgical decompression may be indicated

# Stress Fractures in the Ankle Complex

Stress fractures involving the ankle complex are not common but it is important that they are not missed in an assessment Treatment of stress fracture in the ankle will most often require non-weight bearing or sometimes surgical internal fixation Following this period of rehabilitation will be required as will correction of any of the factors that contributed to the problem in the first place such as faulty lower limb biomechanics technique faults excessive training load metabolic or nutritional factors

# Acute Treatment and Rehabilitation of the Lateral Ankle Sprain

Following an ankle sprain it is necessary to embark upon comprehensive and progressive rehabilitation programme A recent study by Aiken and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that although there was natural recovery of strength and dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) within 1 month following grade I or II ankle sprain more sensitive measures of ankle performance demonstrated ongoing deficits in those patients that did not receive rehabilitation intervention The authors suggested that the ongoing disability following an ankle sprain in people who received only standard emergency care provided evidence of the need for more comprehensive rehabilitation plan This result has been augmented by study which demonstrated the superiority of structured 4-week rehabilitation programme compared to non-intervention control group on postural control and lower limb function in individuals with chronic ankle instability (Hale et al 2007) A comprehensive rehabilitation aims to control pain and swelling restore full joint ROM and kinematics proprioceptive function muscle strength and functional performance

# Acute Management

The principles of acute ankle injury management are similar to those of other joints namely to protect the joint and to reduce pain and effusion Protecting the joint primarily involves preventing further damage This may involve removal from the field of play or reducing weight bearing with crutches Severe ankle sprains may benefit from short-term immobilization

# Common Sites of Stress Fractures

|Site|Predominantly Seen In|Characteristics|
|---|---|---|
|Medial malleolus|Distance runners|Persistent medial ankle pain that is aggravated by cyclical load-bearing|
|Navicular|Distance runners and jumping athletes|Poorly localized antero-medial pain Requires strict adherence to NWB protocol|
|Posterolateral talus|Track and field athletes|Lateral ankle pain aggravated by running and jumping Secondary to excessive plantarflexion and subtalar joint instability|
|Calcaneus|Distance runners and jumping athletes|Gradual onset of heel pain made worse by weightbearing Pain may be reproduced by squeezing the posterior aspect of the calcaneus|

# Cryotherapy in Acute Management

The use of cryotherapy is widely practiced in the acute management of acute soft tissue injuries The purported benefits of this are the early control of oedema and haemorrhage from damaged vessels as well as pain relief Whilst theoretical argument can be made to support these claims as yet there is very little substantive proof that the use of cryotherapy improves clinical outcomes following ankle or other soft tissue injury (Collins 2008)

The most common method of cryotherapy is applying crushed ice directly to the injured area although plunging the injured ankle into bucket of iced water is potentially more effective as it combines both the reduced temperature and the compression provided by the water required to restrict vessel diameter and thereby reduce plasma leakage from the vessels The cooling effect of the ice also helps to reduce pain and may potentially lower cell metabolism thereby reducing the hypoxia that can lead to cell death

In the first 48 hours immersing the ankle into an ice bath should be for maximum of 20 minutes (intermittently) but should be encouraged every 2 hours In between times horseshoe fabricated from felt or foam can be placed around the malleolus and secured with compressive bandage Anti-inflammatory medications are discouraged initially because the inflammatory process is necessary for the healing process to commence but may be commenced after 48 hours to ensure that the inflammatory process is not excessive in particular to control the collateral damage that may be caused by excessive neutrophil-mediated activity Recently there have been some encouraging signs that anti-inflammatory medications either taken orally or applied topically can be safely consumed/applied and that there is corresponding decrease in pain and improvements in short-term ankle function (Banning 2008; Bleakley et al 2008)

# Restoration of Joint ROM and Kinematics

Full weight bearing should be encouraged as soon as possible so long as the gait pattern is not antalgic This may necessitate an initial period of partial weight bearing with crutches or walking in pool (to reduce loading) Manual therapy to restore normal talo-crural kinematics and motion at the subtalar and midtarsal joints can be beneficial It has been suggested that there may be positional fault at the inferior tibio-fibular joint following an acute ankle sprain (Kavanagh 1999) and this may need to be assessed and corrected with mobilisations Active mobilisations should be commenced as soon as is comfortable and this may involve the use of stationary bike or cross-trainer hourly range of motion exercises and lunging (particularly in bucket of iced water)

# Proprioceptive Retraining

Ankle injuries can disrupt the ’s neuromuscular feedforward and feedback mechanisms which may be displayed as reduced proprioception Proprioception is the internally generated afferent information arising from peripheral areas of the that contributes to postural control and joint stability It is made up of joint position sense kinaesthesia and resistance/force sense (Riemann and Lephart 2002)

There is strong evidence that people with chronically unstable ankles demonstrate proprioceptive deficits whether it be in errors in detecting ankle positions prior to ground contact (Konradsen 2002) failure to accurately replicate passively positioned joint angles (Willems et al 2002) or an inability to accurately set appropriate muscle force levels to provide joint stability prior to landing from jump (Docherty and Miller 2002; Docherty and Arnold 2008) It seems that these proprioceptive deficits impair the athlete’s ability to prepare the ankle to accept and transfer load in challenging athletic tasks such as changing directions and landing from jump

There is no overwhelming argument for definitive cause of such proprioceptive deficits although alterations in gamma-motoneuron activity affecting muscle spindle sensitivity and reducing the “dynamic defence system” of the ankle are thought to predispose the athlete to repeated bouts of instability (Hertel 2002) Indeed recent study showed that proprioceptive training was more effective than orthotics or strength training in reducing the rates of ankle sprains in male soccer players (Mohammadi 2007)

Given these proprioceptive deficits are noted in the chronically unstable ankle it is important to commence proprioceptive training very early on in the rehabilitation programme Initially this may involve single leg standing and can be made more challenging by performing this with eyes closed and on less stable surfaces such as trampoline Wobble boards

The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is dynamic lower limb reaching test that has been shown to be sensitive in detecting subjects with chronic ankle instability (Olmsted et al 2002) It involves standing on the ground with the affected foot and reaching as far as possible to touch but not weight-bear on eight diagonal lines positioned 45 degrees from each other in star shape Essentially any activity that challenges the ’s proprioceptive system is useful and the more the system receives the better

The proprioceptive programme should be progressive fun challenging functional and goal-oriented towards the sport-specific demands Additionally as healing progresses the stress that the ankle is put under during these proprioceptive drills needs to be increased to include jumping hopping turning and cutting tasks There are no specific rules about progressing the drills but each of the variables should be taken into consideration It may be that an athlete has no problems with any of them but their ankle feels unstable when they are fatigued In this case this is the variable that needs to be concentrated on The athlete is allowed back to competition once they can demonstrate that they can complete the requisite parts of their sports-specific proprioceptive tasks during rehabilitation

# Muscle Strengthening

All directions of motion should be considered when prescribing exercises for muscle strengthening and conditioning around the ankle This may involve the
---
# Acute Treatment and Rehabilitation of the Lateral Ankle Sprain

# Strengthening Exercises

The use of elastic tubing or weighted cables is recommended for strengthening the ankle The ankle should be stressed both concentrically and eccentrically As pain permits the ankle’s range of motion should improve and it is important to strengthen into the new range progressively working into more plantarflexion and inversion

Interestingly while strength is an important consideration during ankle rehabilitation deficits in ankle strength are not highly correlated with chronic ankle instability (Kaminski 2006) However recent findings suggest there may be deficit in eccentric plantar flexion strength in subjects with functional ankle instability (Fox et al 2008) Therefore it is advisable to include eccentric strengthening towards the later stages of rehabilitation program

Additionally it has been reported that there may also be deficit in knee flexion and knee extension average torque values in subjects with history of ankle sprains indicating that proximal neuromuscular adaptations should be assessed and appropriately managed (Gribble and Robinson 2009) The clinical significance of these findings is that muscle strength should be assessed but not be used as the only benchmark for return to sport It is also important to maintain cardiovascular fitness and total strength during the rehabilitation process especially if the athlete is taking an extended period away from their sport due to the injury

# Functional Retraining

Once the athlete demonstrates return of full ankle range of motion (ROM) and appropriate levels of muscle strength fatigue resistance and proprioception (as determined by the SEBT) they can progress to more functional sports-specific tasks This progression should involve careful analysis of the sport's requirements and its impacts on the ankle

For example basketball player's rehabilitation program may progress from jumping on the spot to jumping for distance and height landing in contest for the ball as well as sudden deceleration and changing direction when running In contrast squash player may focus more on lunging and rapid pivoting on the foot

Frequently athletes will require the application of tape to support the ankle when returning to more vigorous activities Depending on the structures that require support this often involves positioning the ankle in dorsiflexion (or at least neutral) and eversion with the application of combination of anchors stirrups calcaneal slings heel locks 6s and sometimes syndesmosis strips Taping has been shown to restrict the amount of ankle inversion (Arnold and Docherty 2004) but the benefit is likely to be largely proprioceptive or even placebo (Sawkins et al 2007)

While there are no high-quality studies on how long taping should be used clinical experience suggests it should be used for as long as the athlete finds it beneficial Nonetheless athletes should be counseled against developing reliance on taping in case it is not possible to use it in the future Ankle braces are commonly used as prophylactic aid to prevent ankle inversion injuries but they may disrupt balance in non-injured athletes (Hardy et al 2008)

The appendix to this chapter includes booklet that can be given to athletes on the day of their acute ankle sprain It is not meant as recipe nor is it exhaustive; rather it provides logical progressive pathway for athletes to complete all tasks required in rehabilitation program There is room for adaptation to include sport-specific drills as needed An outcome measure (such as the Foot and Ankle Score the Standardised Orthopaedic Assessment Tool or the Chronic Ankle Instability Scale) can be administered at the start and conclusion of the program to gauge the athlete's progress

# Risk Factors for Ankle Sprains

Several factors have been proposed as risks for ankle sprains over the years A recent study suggested that slower running speed poor cardiorespiratory endurance impaired joint position sense increased postural sway decreased tibialis anterior strength decreased dorsiflexion ROM and increased activity of the gastro-soleus complex were associated with an increased risk of ankle inversion sprains in males (Willems et al 2005) Another study indicated that decrease in ankle dorsiflexion ROM is strongly associated with an increased risk for ankle sprains (de Noronha et al 2006) Given the high rates of chronic ankle instability previous ankle sprain is perhaps the most significant risk factor

# Ankle Complex Injuries in Sport

# Chronic Ankle Instability

The rate of recurrence of an ankle sprain has been reported to be as high as 80% (Yeung et al 1994) and yet the reasons why this rate is so high are still somewhat mysterious Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is the term used to describe the occurrence of repeated bouts of instability leading to numerous ankle sprains (Hertel 2002) It has been estimated that CAI occurs in 30–40% of individuals who suffer first-time ankle sprains but the occurrence of residual symptoms and decreased function are reported to be much higher (Hertel 2006) CAI gives rise to repeated complaints of pain swelling giving way and degenerative joint disease Interestingly it appears that CAI is independent of the severity of the original injury and of the treatment received (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002) It is unclear why some individuals go on to suffer CAI The mechanism of recurrent ankle sprains is not thought to be dramatically different from that of an initial sprain Clearly there is no such thing as simple ankle sprain

# Types of Ankle Instability

Ankle instability can be due to mechanical causes or functional causes

# Mechanical Ankle Instability (MAI)

MAI refers to repeated episodes of ‘giving way’ due to structural abnormalities within the ankle complex This can be due to:

- Pathological ligamentous laxity
- Arthrokinematic abnormalities (such as restricted posterior talar glide in the mortise that limits the ankle’s ability to reach fully dorsiflexed (ie close-packed) position)
- Synovial inflammation and degenerative joint changes (such as degenerative osteochondral lesions)

# Functional Ankle Instability (FAI)

FAI is said to occur when there are repeated episodes of ‘giving-way’ without specific mechanical cause (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002) FAI is complex matrix of contributing factors that may include:

- Impaired proprioception (joint position sense kinaesthesia and joint resistance sense) (Hertel 2002)
- Muscle weakness and arthrogenic muscle inhibition
- Altered postural equilibrium sense (Riemann 2002)
- Reduction in preparatory muscle activity to stabilize the ankle prior to ground contact (Hertel 2006)

It appears that CAI may be the product of an interaction between MAI and FAI although despite burgeoning research into this area the precise nature and interaction of all the contributing factors is still unclear (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002) An interesting area of current research is concentrating on the possibilities that delayed trunk reflexes may predispose an individual to CAI It seems that central nervous system adaptations in the manner of delayed stabilization times are found in individuals with FAI which is finding somewhat akin to those found in individuals with low back pain (Marshall et al 2009) A deeper appreciation of the features of CAI will help provide the sports clinician with framework to structure comprehensive rehabilitation plan aiming at not just the management of the acute ankle sprain but also the avoidance of the potential chronic sequelae Certainly four-week rehabilitation plan designed to address the strength range of motion neuromuscular control and functional deficits seen in patients with CAI has been shown to be beneficial in reversing these trends (Hale et al 2007) although as yet there have not been enough longitudinal studies undertaken to determine the long-term effect of such interventional strategies on recurrence rates

# Ankle Injury Prevention

There are many interventions that are purported to be beneficial in the prevention of ankle injuries It follows that only the modifiable risk factors for ankle injuries could be prevented Clearly past history of ankle sprains the biggest risk factor cannot be modified A high mass index is another variable that has been identified as risk factor for non-contact ankle sprains (Gomez et al 1998) It has not been conclusively proven why this is the case but it has

# Case Study: Ankle Injury

# Assessment

# History

Allan 21-year-old semi-professional footballer presents with right ankle sprain sustained 24 hours ago during training The injury mechanism was plantarflexion-inversion trauma when he landed awkwardly following jumping drill He felt pain immediately around the lateral ankle region but was able to limp unaided to the sidelines where he applied ice immediately

He has ‘turned’ his right ankle on several occasions in the past three years once every three months on average Mostly these incidents are trivial in nature and not accompanied by any significant dysfunction although he has had to miss about five games in total over the past three years due to ankle sprains

Allan’s first ankle sprain occurred almost four years ago when he slipped on rock while fishing He was unable to play sport properly for about two months following this original incident No specific diagnosis was made at the time although he remembers it being markedly swollen and he could not run for about month He reports his ankles as feeling “weak” since then but has not seen clinician about it before He generally does not tape his ankle although he does occasionally borrow his brother’s ankle brace

He has no other injury or medical history does not smoke and is generally fit and well

# Observations

Allan was able to limp into the clinic unaided but his gait was clearly antalgic Walking with more weight through his right leg increased his distress There was marked effusion around the lateral ankle that extended into the postero-lateral gutter Some bruising was evident distal to the lateral malleolus

# Area of Pain

Allan was asked to point with one finger to his area of pain He indicated moderately large area around the antero-lateral ankle The therapist then gently passively plantarflexed and inverted his ankle and he was able to more precisely locate the pain around the area of the ATFL

# Active Movements

The most painful movement directions were plantarflexion plus inversion combined movement that is known to stress the ATFL He was unable to actively lunge due to pain on weight bearing Resisted eversion was moderately painful

# Ankle Complex Injuries in Sport

note 

# Ankle Complex Injuries in Sport

# Assessment

Allan presented with pain indicating that the peroneal tendons may have been implicated by traction-type force Knee and hip range of motion (ROM) were full and pain-free

# Passive Movements

Corresponding with the active movements plantarflexion plus inversion was painful Eversion and dorsiflexion were pain-free Knee and hip ROM were full and pain-free

# Stress Tests

The anterior drawer test was painful and showed increased excursion although the amount of swelling precluded definitive grading The talar tilt test showed no increase in movement

# Functional Tests

Due to the acute nature of the injury functional tests were not considered appropriate as Allan struggled with basic tasks like walking A knee-to-wall measurement was taken as an objective benchmark showing 05 cm compared to 9 cm on the uninjured left side

# Palpation

Palpation of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reproduced Allan’s pain His distal fibula was non-painful as was the base of the 5th metatarsal These findings along with the fact that he could walk into the clinic negated the need for immediate radiological investigations

# Education and Initial Management

Allan was educated regarding the diagnosis pain mechanisms involved treatment plan and likely prognosis It was important to inform him about chronic ankle instability (CAI) and the necessity for full rehabilitation to reduce the risk of further injuries

RICE Regimen:
- Iced water immersion for 20 minutes performing 10 forward leans with the ankle immersed every 5 minutes
- Application of an elasticized compressive bandage with padded felt "horseshoe" around the lateral malleolus for uniform compression

Basic balance exercises were prescribed Allan was provided with elbow crutches and instructed to put weight on the injured side only as tolerated The motto was "It is preferable to walk well with an aid than poorly without" He was instructed in the safe usage of crutches on flat surfaces and stairs

# Assessment (Day 3)

Allan showed significant improvement over the two days following the injury He was able to walk well without crutches The ankle was swollen but much less than 48 hours previously He still experienced pain when the ankle was plantarflexed and had not attempted to jog His functional status was reclassified to grade II

# Analysis

It was concluded that Allan had sustained an acute ATFL injury While the clinician was unable to assess the degree of laxity in the ATFL it was decided that he was functioning as Grade III injury Given Allan’s history of ankle sprains this was concluded to be an acute episode of CAI

# Management (Days 1-3)

The initial priority for management was to protect the injured area and limit excessive inflammatory reactions Consequently the interventions were focused on this goal

# Management (Days 4-7)

The focus of management shifted towards functional restoration Allan had access to local gymnasium with pool allowing him to walk in the pool for gait re-education This environment was ideal for commencing lunging and provided challenging setting for balance retraining Resistive hip strengthening pelvic control and functional balance work were initiated during this period Manual therapy concentrated on normalizing muscle tone around the ankle

# Appendix – 21-Day Ankle Sprain Rehabilitation Booklet

# Assessment (Day 8)

At the beginning of week 2 Allan’s pain was absent during all Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and he was able to jog in straight line Additionally whilst there was still some swelling evident around the lateral aspect of his ankle the postero-lateral gutter had cleared and bruising was no longer evident His knee-to-wall measurement was 6cm He was considered to have functional grade I+ strain by this stage

# Management (Days 8–14)

Week two’s programme showed progressive increase in lower limb load both statically and dynamically There was gradual increase in gait speed from walking to jogging initially in straight lines and then in gentle curves Some agility work was introduced using ladders and other proprioceptive drills He was asked to monitor his symptoms (pain and swelling) after each session and if there was an increase in symptoms he was not allowed to progress to the next day’s programme Towards the end of the week he was able to complete slalom agility courses at up to 80% speed He was permitted to return to non-competitive sub-threshold football training He was winger and so running speed programme was given to him by the coach and he was permitted to re-commence striking non-moving ball over progressively longer distances

Manual therapy continued throughout this week and by day 14 talo-crual joint mechanics had been restored By day 14 he was considered to have grade I strain This was because he was still getting small amount of swelling following the second loading session of the day

# Assessment (Day 15)

Allan had regained full physiological and accessory movement of his ankle complex by this stage There was approximately 2–3mm of extra anterior draw It was unable to be ascertained whether this was due to the most recent injury or was pre-existing

# Management (Days 15–21)

The aims of the 3rd week of the programme were to integrate specific functional tasks into his rehabilitation He was joining in with training drills and specific emphasis was placed on tackling jumping/hopping and deceleration drills Additionally specific gluteal strength-endurance tasks were included and high-level proprioceptive drills were performed He completed full training session on day 17 without any latent pain or refractory swelling He played competitive cup match at day 22

# Ongoing Management

Given that Allan had long history of ankle sprains resisted ankle strengthening work as well as proprioceptive drills focusing on landing mechanics (for example hopping onto wobble board/landing from step into sandpit) were continued three times per week for the next two months The programme that Allan followed is included in the Appendix

# Ankle Complex Injuries in Sport

# Week 3: Skill and Prevention of Further Injury

Sport specific drills functional balance retraining high-level muscle activity and return to full training

# Acute Management

This refers to the first 48 hours after your ankle injury and is vital in your overall recovery Following an injury and subsequent tissue damage your responds through process of inflammation Inflammation is good for us and is necessary part of the healing process The problem is the response can be bit exaggerated and so we look to reduce the amount of swelling That is why you are required to ice and compress the ankle in the early stages

# Assessment

A physiotherapy and perhaps medical review is necessary to assess the extent of your injury and proceed with any further investigations (such as an x-ray or MRI) if deemed necessary The physiotherapist will also inform you when you can start this rehabilitation program It is expected that you will complete every level as described; if you have any questions about or problems with the exercises you must discuss these with your physiotherapist at the time

# How to Use an Ice Bath

- Half fill suitable container with cold water and add ice
- Place your foot into the container; making sure the site of injury is well covered
- Every 5 minutes take your foot out of the water and perform 10 ankle lunges so long as they are not too painful Repeat this 4 times
- After this process dry your foot and apply the compression bandage
- Repeat this process every hour if possible

# Compression

Compression can be very effective in controlling the swelling that often accompanies an ankle sprain You will also be provided with foam horseshoe to compress the areas around the outside of your ankle bone Make sure you don’t apply the bandage too tight or it may restrict blood flow If necessary you will be provided with an aircast boot to reduce the risk of re-injury in the acute phase It is important that you follow your physio’s advice regarding wearing the boot even if you feel that it is too bulky

# Week 1

Date programme started: day 1 (day of injury)

The following exercises should be completed TWICE on day 1

# Ice

Ice applied to the injury site helps limit bleeding and controls inflammation in the ankle and can also help in pain relief The best manner of cooling the injury is the use of an ice bath because the water provides compression as well It also reduces the risk of an ice burn that may occur by applying ice directly onto the skin

# Balance

1 Single leg balance with eyes closed: Standing on floor 8 times for 30 seconds
2 STAR Excursion: Standing on injured leg touch down (but don’t weight bear) on all 8 points Repeat 5 times

Because excessive cooling may be counterproductive icing needs to be limited to 20-minute periods

# Strength

Double leg calf raises (knees straight and bent): From the floor and within pain limits 3 sets of 12

# Introduction

Foot injuries can be challenging to properly diagnose treat and rehabilitate Taking the forces of the whole plus additional impact sometimes reaching several times mass the foot is under tremendous stress In sport the foot absorbs loading and shearing forces and to manage the disorders associated there must be good understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of the foot To understand treat and rehabilitate foot problems working knowledge of the individual sports and the injuries that are commonly associated with techniques and training methods is essential

A study by Vereecke and Aerts (2008) on gibbons the most bipedal of non-human primates and the most distant relatives of humans within the ape lineage indicated the human foot evolved from one that was primarily of an arboreal (tree dweller) nature to one that was kind of hybrid and finally to the very flexible yet simultaneously force absorbent locomotive mechanism adapted to bipedalism Vereecke et al (2005) maintained an arboreal compliant foot may not be the most effective mechanism for push-off during bipedal locomotion particularly when compared to the more rigid arched foot of humans but it does contribute to propulsion in as much as it uses stored elastic energy from passive stretch and recoil of the tendons and ligaments on the plantar side of the foot

We do still possess extremes of foot posture which tend to predispose to increased potential for injury in sport (Burns et al 2005) coupled with the tendency for some foot types being more suited to certain sports and susceptible to types of injury (Barnes et al 2008) In general terms higher arched semi-rigid feet are more prevalent in short-contact endurance-based sports like distance running and flatter flexible feet to more powerful longer contact sports like sprinting and rugby Burns et al (2005) demonstrate that athletes with conflicting foot type to their discipline appear to be more prone to injury as with any biomechanical preferences of certain sports As with many other parts of the human anatomy that are functioning and adapting constantly the foot is only noticed when it fails to function in its subliminal reliable way

# High Arched Semi-Rigid Feet

In extreme these feet have been described as Pes Cavus or even Claw Foot This primarily genetic defect in the foot has high arch which is relatively inflexible This will often be associated with tight calf muscles combined with reduced dorsiflexion and predispose to toe running even at slow speeds with little or no heel contact There is also tendency to ‘roll’ the foot from lateral to medial which may

# The Foot in Sport

# Foot Types

Athletes find they need to stretch the calf muscles before and particularly after activity for around 30 seconds repeated three times once day (Bandy et al 1997) and maintain dorsiflexion although stretching before and after exercise has not been shown to necessarily reduce risk of injury (Herbert and Gabriel 2002) Shoe type selection is difficult as there needs to be support to counter the impact and flexibility to allow some compensatory movement (Orendurff et al 2008)

# Flat Flexible Feet

Again primarily inherent this foot type requires shoe selection to provide motion control to avoid stress on structures in some activities but allow enough movement to tolerate longer contact impact in others (Chuckpalwong et al 2008)

Injuries caused by either overuse or as result of structural non-conformity to the sport are similar in that only through significant activity do pre-existing or underlying structural problems usually reveal themselves The development of an extremely wide choice of shoes insoles and orthoses means there is the potential to influence the right compensatory combination to reduce injury potential but also increases the need for more experience and knowledge of sport specifics shoe construction and supplemental biomechanical device prescription

# Foot Injuries

Foot injuries can be divided into three anatomical and structural areas:

1 Rearfoot
2 Midfoot
3 Forefoot

# Injuries to the Rearfoot

# Plantar Fasciitis

Buchbinder (2004) maintains plantar fasciitis is not only the most common cause of pain in the inferior heel but is responsible for approximately 10% of all running-related injuries Plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the plantar fascia which may radiate into the arch of the foot aggravated by weight bearing and propulsive activity It is an overuse injury usually causing plantar proximal and medial pain which may radiate distally to the mid-arch A strain or sometimes rupture with either gradual or sudden overload is quite common especially in the active sport population

Plantar fasciitis can be related to ‘heel spur’ which is bony exostosis at the attachment of the plantar fascia to the calcaneus A heel spur is believed to be caused by repetitive stress from the plantar fascia attachment and can be present on the asymptomatic foot; or painful heel may have no heel spur (Ryan 2007)

# Injuries to the Rearfoot

# Injuries to the Rearfoot

# Predisposing Factors

Predisposing factors for rearfoot injuries include:

- Increased weight
- Pronation and/or ankle eversion
- Prolonged periods of standing
- Reduced ankle dorsiflexion
- High arches

In sports it is often associated with harder training surfaces or increased intensity or duration of training (Huerta et al 2008)

# Lateral Plantar Nerve Compression

The lateral plantar nerve passes through the tarsal tunnel between the abductor hallucis muscle and the quadratus planus muscle It may become compressed causing similar pain under the heel and sometimes up towards the medial ankle

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Rest including unloading the foot with supportive taping and even crutches in the early stages is essential (Cole et al 2005) A night splint to hold the foot stretched into dorsiflexion can reduce the overnight tendency to tighten Manual tissue release techniques and needling can be effective to reduce tension in the usually tight tissue Ultrasound guided needle fasciotomy is relatively new minimally invasive procedure where needle is inserted into the plantar fascia to possibly disrupt the fibrous tissue that forms as result of chronic inflammation

A gradual return to loading with incremental strengthening and rehabilitation can be frustrating for the athlete as it may take several weeks to strengthen Many coaches have found movement drills in sandpits to be beneficial and preventative After biomechanical evaluation insoles or orthotics may help reduce stress but may be too compressive during the acute phase Injection may be helpful short term (Selman 1994) but must be combined with stretching and biomechanical influence to prevent recurrence Extracorporeal shock therapy inducing significant vibratory impact directly to the area has conflicting research evidence (Buchbinder 2002; Sems et al 2006)

# Heel Contusion

Repetitive impact on the heel can cause the fat pad that protects the calcaneus to be pushed up the side of the heel leaving less of protective layer Sometimes called ‘policeman’s heel’ it is common in sports requiring repetitive impact on the heel like the hopping foot in triple jump If managed early it should recover within few days If not and it becomes chronic it can be long recovery as continued weight bearing tends to sustain the injury This is considered to be related to bursa between the calcaneum and the fat pad (Irving et al 2007)

# Treatment and Rehabilitation for Heel Contusion

Insoles are more effective than heel pads as they dissipate rather than concentrate pressure; plus pads raising the heel without supporting the arch destabilize the foot increasing stress on the arch (Gosky et al 2006) This is particularly important for high arched feet where an unsupported arch leaves the heel and forefoot exposed to more impact stress Taping the heel can compress the soft tissue

# Calcaneal Stress Fracture

A stress fracture can occur in the calcaneum as result of cumulative impact It is common in sports like long distance running (Fredricson et al 2006) particularly with athletes who predominantly heel strike rather than mid to forefoot strike which tends to be the heavier jogger or slower running athlete

The majority of plantar heel pain is probably diagnosed as plantar fasciitis or as heel spurs When the history or examination findings are atypical or when routine treatment is ineffective consideration should be given to atypical causes of heel pain (Webber et al 2005) Stress fractures of the calcaneus are possibly frequently unrecognised source of heel pain In some cases they can continue to go unrecognised because the symptoms of calcaneal stress fracture sometimes improve with treatments aimed at soft tissue injuries

Calcaneal stress fractures can occur in any population of adults and are common among active people such as running athletes It is very likely that the incidence of diagnosed calcaneal stress fractures will rise with an increased consideration of their possibility Commonly (Webber et al 2005) there is an insidious gradual onset pain made worse by weight bearing Pain is reproduced by squeezing the back of the heel from both sides X-ray will frequently not show any sign of fracture at all or until after approximately two weeks

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

A stress fracture should be suspected if there is inactive or night pain and requires rest from impact for 6–8 weeks often including crutches in the early stages (McRae and Esser 2008) Return to sporting impact must be gradual Ideally starting with minimal heel weight bearing activities like hydrotherapy cycling and rowing; progressing to elliptical trainer and treadmill intervals before running Conversely it may be more appropriate to run quicker intervals on toes rather than slower runs with more heel impact initially Appropriate shoes with insoles or orthotics to dissipate impact are advisable

# Nerve Entrapment

This can be described as ‘tarsal tunnel syndrome’ or ‘medial calcaneal nerve entrapment’ The two conditions are similar with variable symptoms of pain that can be in the heel toes or the arch of the foot and numbness and/or pins and needles may be felt in the sole of the foot There is usually pain when standing and more when running ‘Tinel’s test’ tapping the nerve just behind the medial malleolus is uncomfortably sensitive Ankle eversion and foot pronation appear to stress and irritate the medial and lateral plantar nerves causing the ‘tarsal tunnel syndrome’ variation (Kinoshita et al 2006)

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Slow controlled non weight-bearing exercise progressing to weight bearing in positions that do not aggravate; passive mobilisation and manipulation cryotherapy (ice treatment) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) which may reduce sensitivity Insoles or orthotics to alter the mechanical loading pattern are sometimes beneficial (DiDomenico and Masternick 2006) However when conservative measures are not successful surgical decompression (Mullick and Dellon 2008) or excision may result in relief of pain fortunately with few potential complications

# Sever's Disease

This condition which is sometimes called calcaneal apophysitis occurs primarily in active children around the age of 9–14 years (Malanga and Ramirez-Del Toro 2008) Although opinion and poorly conducted retrospective case series make up the majority of evidence on this condition (Scharfbillig et al 2008) it is usually associated with rapid growth spurt combined with repetitive weight bearing propulsive and braking activity and tight calf muscles Athletes typically complain of heel pain or soreness that improves with rest and increases with running There is usually tenderness at the back of the heels especially if you press in or give it squeeze from the sides

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Rest from impact and propulsion usually resolves the condition but this may be slow when the growth spurt is ongoing

# Injuries to the Rearfoot

# Sever's Disease

The calcaneum is active Use of brace or cast does help probably by inhibiting activity as well as weight bearing A biomechanical assessment may indicate potential reasons for increased stress on the heel which if reduced by insoles or orthoses may assist recovery (Hendrix 2005) The most consistent difference between normal and Sever’s patients is related to the more fragmented nature of the symptomatic epiphysis which may suggest mechanical etiology for that condition (Volpon and de Carvalho Filho 2002) Modified types of training with less impact are therefore usually necessary for prevention or resolution

# Retrocalcaneal Bursitis and Haglund's Deformity

Pain at the back of the heel caused by an inflamed bursa which is situated between the Achilles tendon and the calcaneum (Haglund 1972) This is common condition in athletes particularly in running-related sports and is often associated with Achilles tendinopathy An MRI study on Achilles tendinopathy enthesitis found retrocalcaneal bursitis in three-quarters of cases (D’Agostini and Olivieri 2006) The key to successful management is proper understanding of the anatomy and pathological processes (Solan and Davies 2007) Sensitivity and swelling are especially aggravated when running uphill or on uneven surfaces Wearing particular shoes that put pressure on the area can aggravate the condition as can pivoting on the heel when driving

A bony growth or exostosis can develop at the posterior calcaneum called ‘Haglund’s deformity’ If conservative management fails then surgery may be necessary to repair the Achilles tendon and reduce the exostosis (Stephens 1994)

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Insoles or orthotics to alter the calcaneal alignment can reduce irritation from the side of the Achilles that may be causing avulsion stress as well as diminish pressure and movement that may be causing frictional irritation (Heneghan and Pavlov 1984) Anti-inflammatory medication orally and even topically as part of the inflammation is superficial with protective dressing usually assists recovery; however injection or even surgery are used in persistent cases

# Achilles Tendinopathy

The Achilles tendon may be damaged and inflamed primarily through overloading during the propulsive phase of the gait cycle It can be injured cumulatively with overtraining without sufficient recovery or suddenly for example by increased quality of training on harder surface (Paavola et al 2002) It is estimated that it may account for about 10% of all running-related pathologies

The Achilles tendon has poor blood supply which is probably why it is slow to recover Chronic Achilles tendinopathy is difficult condition to treat

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Wearing an insole/orthotic (Pope et al 2009) rather than heel raise that destabilises will raise the heel and reduce dorsiflexion and propulsive stress This should only be temporary during recovery or loss of length and restricted dorsiflexion may occur Anti-inflammatory medication may assist in the early stages but it must not be mechanism just to allow more activity except in the case of carefully managed rehabilitation exercises like Alfredson’s regime

Biomechanical causes may be positively influenced by orthotics alongside modifying technique and possibly the training programme Mobilisation of sub-talar or talo-calcaneal joint eversion may help in improving alignment (Harper 1991) and creating more tolerant stress variability Taping to support the tendon may assist recovery and in acute or stubborn cases bracing or cast can be used initially Tissue release massage techniques can assist in reducing tightness in the calf complex especially when the athlete is going through the protective phase (Davidson et al 1997) Poor clinical evidence supported the use of deep friction massage in Cochrane review in 2002 showing no obvious benefit although the reviewers were not evaluating Achilles tendons in particular (Brosseau et al 2002)

McCrory et al (1999) concluded that strengthening exercises (see below for specific details) and orthotics to control the degree of rear foot pronation should be utilised for athletes suffering from Achilles tendinopathy Loss of calcaneal movement especially eversion is probably related and needs more research Corticosteroid injection may be used in chronic situations; however an injection directly into the tendon is not recommended as it may increase the risk of total rupture Rehabilitation is essential; otherwise the condition is likely to return with increased loading Wallmann’s (2000) and Alfredson et al (1998) regimes are now used widely but there is some debate as to whether the exercises are strengthening or reflect specific stretching programme directed at the structures (Allison and Purdam 2009)

# Wallmann's Regime

Starting with daily 5–10 minute warm-up of gentle cardiovascular exercise preferably non-weight bearing such as cycling This is followed by basic calf raise exercise using weight on the floor progressed by increasing the load and speed of the eccentric lowering

The exercise should feel hard but not painful If the workout feels the same or easier the next day then increase to level two difficulty on the next day Progress until the athlete can achieve level five which may take weeks to months

# Level 1:

- Straight leg heel raise with the uninjured leg
- Then put the toes of the injured leg down and lower both legs slowly over 5 seconds
- Repeat for 10 repetitions 3 sets with 30 seconds recovery (this remains the same for all levels)
- Increase the lowering speed to 2 seconds and to 1 second as discomfort allows (this remains the same for all levels)
- Progress to 20 degrees bent knee heel raise to load the Soleus more

# Level 2:

- Progress to both legs for lowering and raising

# Level 3:

- Progress to the uninjured leg alone during the raising phase and the injured leg alone lowering

# Injuries to the Rearfoot

# Alfredson's Regime

Alfredson's regime is designed to rehabilitate the Achilles tendon through structured eccentric loading program The protocol is as follows:

- Duration: Twice day for 12 weeks
- Exercise: Calf raise with the forefoot placed on step
- Technique: The athlete shifts weight pushing up on the uninjured leg and lowering down on the injured leg slowly and in control (eg 5 seconds up and 10 seconds down)
- Repetitions: Three sets of 15 repetitions for both straight-leg and bent-leg calf raises
- Progression: Increase the eccentric loading by adding weights to backpack or using calf-raise resistance machine over the 12 weeks

Alfredson emphasizes increased loading rather than speed and focuses on eccentric lowering through full range of movement This contrasts with Wallmann’s regime which may be more suitable for faster lighter shorter contact exercises Current research suggests that Wallmann’s exercises in the inner range may be more effective for distal enthesopathy while Alfredson’s exercises which include an outer range stretch element are beneficial for other cases

Alfredson's research compared two groups: one that underwent surgery and another that followed the 12-week program Both groups returned to normal activity with similar levels of pain relief indicating that progressive emphasis on eccentric loading is viable alternative to surgery

In summary early intervention and proper rehabilitation of the tendon can lead to good recovery Studies have shown strong correlation between effective clinical results and eccentric training (Niesen-Vertommen et al 1992) as well as marked reduction in neovascularization of the tendon (Ohberg et al 2004; Knobloch 2007) Magnussen et al (2009) found that eccentric exercises have the most evidence of effectiveness in treating mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy

Evidence supporting the use of heel pads heparin injections and peritendinous steroid injections is weak Ongoing research (Almekinders and Temple 1998) is exploring newer approaches including glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches (Paoloni et al 2004) and gene transfer techniques for platelet-derived growth factor and other growth factors that enhance healing and promote type I collagen growth in the tendon (Maffulli et al 2002)

# Achilles Tendon Rupture

Most individuals with an Achilles tendon rupture have history of prior tendinopathy (Cetti et al 2003) The Achilles tendon can partially tear or completely rupture with total ruptures being more common among recreational older athletes

The classic presentation includes sudden sharp pain accompanied by distinct bang as if something has hit the back of the leg Surprisingly subsequent pain may not be as severe as expected and movement may not be as painful due to the lack of connection

# The Foot in Sport - Rehabilitation and Treatment

# The Foot in Sport

# Rehabilitation and Treatment

There is evidence of higher re-rupture rate associated with different rehabilitation methods However some believe that the differences in rehabilitation may be significant indicating need for more research

Athletes are usually out of competition for 6–12 months depending on rehabilitation accuracy motivation and the type of sport (Maffulli and Ajis 2008) Progressive rehabilitation is essential for maximum recovery starting with non- and partial weight-bearing exercises using hydrotherapy cycling etc and progressing to weight-bearing propulsive and finally explosive activity

# Peroneal Tendon Injuries

Athletes with peroneal tendon dislocation typically present with acute pain and swelling behind the lateral malleolus (Brandes and Smith 2000) These symptoms are caused by dorsiflexion-inversion stress injury of the ankle that pulls the peroneal retinaculum off the lateral malleolus (Slater 2007) Athletes usually complain of snapping and sudden sharp pain when changing direction or pushing forward with subsequent loss of eversion strength

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

It is recommended that the sooner the tendon is operated on to suture the ends together the better the chance of full recovery The reported surgical success rates vary between 75–100% (Paavola et al 2002) Progressive plastering without surgery has been used effectively but tends not to be as successful

On physical examination there is usually tenderness to palpation along the course of the peroneal tendons often with swelling A provocative test for peroneal pathology involves having the athlete's foot hanging in relaxed position with the knee flexed at 90 degrees Slight pressure is applied to the peroneal tendons posterior to the fibula and the patient is then asked to dorsiflex and evert the foot against resistance

# Injuries to the Middle of the Foot

# Midfoot Stress Fractures

Stress fractures occur as result of prolonged repeated loads on the foot in the navicular talus and metatarsals usually the second third and fourth (Snyder et al 2006) Long distance runners are particularly susceptible to this type of injury and experience pain in the affected bone during and when established after exercise when resting and even pain at night The nature of the running process especially with increased forefoot loading may help to explain the incidence of stress fractures of the metatarsals under fatiguing loading conditions (Weist et al 2004) There may be palpable tenderness and swelling at the specific point of the injury but not always

The navicular bone is subject to one of the most common stress fractures seen in athletes especially those involved in sprinting and higher foot impact sports like high jump It presents with poorly localized midfoot ache particularly during and after activity Pain resolves with rest but soon returns with resumed activity It is usually sensitive to direct pressure on the navicular and can be picked up with bone scan CT or MRI but may not be evident on X-ray

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Treatment for stress fractures is initially very light to non-weight bearing with crutches and possibly immobilization in boot or cast for several weeks until the palpable tenderness disappears (Dugan and Weber 2007) Insoles or orthotics which support and change the line of stress through the foot are prudent (Finestone et al 1999) Gradual progressive loading over several weeks depending on the intensity of the sport back towards full activity is essential It is important to mobilize the stiff ankle subtalar and mid-tarsal joints Increase in dorsiflexion by controlled lunging exercises and hydrotherapy helps unload pressure on the midfoot Oral analgesics as required are considered preferable to anti-inflammatories as they may inhibit repair (Harder and An 2003)

# Midfoot Tendinopathy

The extensor tendons on the dorsum of the foot can become inflamed causing pain and swelling especially when the tendons are passively stretched Inflammation of tibialis anterior is the most common and extensor digitorum is the least Shoes that are inappropriate or do not provide adequate support can exacerbate this condition

# Common Foot Injuries in Sports

Footwear laced too tight can cause pain and swelling on the dorsum of the foot particularly in running-related sports This is exacerbated by repeated braking and hills where the extensors lift the foot or downhill where they work eccentrically to slow the foot (Scott et al 2005) Changes in training regime terrain or slippery surfaces can also trigger this condition An underlying metatarsal stress fracture may be indicated by resting and night pain or when the forefoot is passively deviated

Flexor tendinopathy of the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus can occur in propulsive and repetitive jumping sports like basketball Peroneal tendinopathy involves the peroneus brevis and longus which assist in plantarflexion and eversion The tendon attaches to the fifth metatarsal on the lateral aspect of the foot and may become tight in distance runners

Swelling may occur on the outside of the ankle or heel with pain directly related to activity especially in sports requiring stability and sideways movement such as racquet sports or movement on uneven ground and slopes Pain is exacerbated by passive inversion and dorsiflexion as well as resisted eversion and plantarflexion

Recent studies suggest that the causes of tendinopathy may be more complex than previously thought (Almekinders et al 2003) Factors such as overuse inflexibility and equipment issues along with tendon degeneration and biomechanical considerations should be included More research is needed to understand the significance of stress-shielding and compression in tendinopathy which may alter prevention and treatment approaches through exercise therapy Current biomechanical studies indicate that certain joint positions are more likely to place tensile stress on the affected tendon area (Almekinders et al 2003)

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Rest and reducing aggravating movements are effective as this is primarily an overuse injury A rehabilitation schedule is essential to strengthen the extensor muscles and stretch the antagonistic calf muscles Anti-inflammatory medication including topical applications tends to be very effective due to the superficial nature of the tendons (Forslund et al 2003) If the condition becomes established steroid injection into the area is usually effective

# Tibialis Posterior Syndrome

The tibialis posterior muscle originates from the posterior tibia and its tendon passes behind the medial malleolus supporting the medial arch Cumulative impact may cause inflammation around the posterior medial malleolus and under the foot where the tendon attaches leading to pain as the tendon slides in the sheath (tenosynovitis) during exercise This syndrome is often associated with increased weight-bearing ankle eversion and foot pronation Athletes may present with plano-valgus (flattened arch) deformity and often participate in sports with sudden stop-start or push-off activities such as soccer football and basketball Patients typically complain of pain inferior to the medial malleolus and decreased range of movement

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Rest for few weeks may resolve acute episodes but support through insoles or orthotics may be necessary long-term (Kulig et al 2009) Steroid injections into the tendon sheath or immobilization in brace or cast can be beneficial Surgery may be required to repair ruptured tibialis posterior tendon which is essential for supporting the arch of the foot

# Tarsal Coalition

Tarsal coalition is congenital fusion of either the calcaneonavicular or talocalcaneal joints usually affecting adolescents as the joints consolidate This condition may cause decreased range of motion in the rearfoot resulting in compensatory pain in the midfoot after weight-bearing training often becoming more apparent after an ankle sprain when the pain does not improve An X-ray can reveal an osseous coalition but an MRI may be necessary to demonstrate fibrous one

The goal of non-surgical treatment for tarsal coalition is to relieve symptoms and reduce motion at the affected joint Treatment and rehabilitation strategies will be tailored to the individual needs of the patient

# Management of Foot Injuries

Management depends on the severity of the condition and the response to treatment (Saxena and Erickson 2003) Sometimes the foot is immobilised to give the affected area rest Anaesthetic injection into the leg may be used to relax spasm and is often performed before immobilisation The foot may benefit from being placed in boot to immobilise and crutches to reduce weight on the foot Management primarily aims to mobilise the joints around the painful complex alongside orthotic devices to distribute the weight away from the joint limiting motion at the joint which may relieve pain

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful in reducing the pain and inflammation If symptoms are not adequately relieved with non-surgical treatment surgery could involve removal of the abnormal connection or arthrodesis (permanent fusion) of the joint The surgeon will determine the best surgical approach based on the patient’s age condition arthritic changes and activity level (Saxena and Erickson 2003)

# Midtarsal Joint Sprain

The midtarsal joint consists of the calcaneo-cuboid and talo-navicular joints A sprain of these joints is more likely to be seen in sports with landing impact like gymnastics or uneven surfaces and change of direction like football Calcaneo-cuboid injury presents with pain and swelling on the lateral dorsum of the foot often occurring in association with an ankle sprain Passive inversion of the foot is uncomfortable X-ray should ideally rule out fracture

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Taping the foot and longer-term insoles or orthotics help support the joint recovery (Willems et al 2005) Exercises to improve and maintain dorsiflexion are important but may have to be patiently employed because of impingement discomfort If symptoms persist steroid injection may aid recovery

Sometimes after severe ankle injury there may also be fracture of the anterior process of the calcaneum Combined active and especially passive plantarflexion and eversion is painful Treatment is similar to that of the calcaneo-cuboid sprain but with longer period of reduced weight bearing and immobilisation and surgery may be considered

# Cuboid Syndrome

Particularly following an ankle inversion sprain the peroneus longus may have excessively pulled on the cuboid causing it to sublux (partially dislocate) resulting in pain when weight bearing on the outside of the foot The mechanism is often associated with peroneal tendinopathy which should also be treated It is involved with locking the foot for strength during various stages of the gait cycle Any instability or dysfunction around the cuboid inhibits functional stability in the foot during propulsion Athletes with cuboid syndrome will tend to evert and pronate more They will avoid forcefully pushing off with the foot Lateral side-to-side sports such as tennis or squash place the greatest strain on this area

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

There is some debate (Patterson 2006) whether the cuboid can or needs to be passively manipulated back into position Non-weight bearing hydrotherapy and swimming can be very beneficial especially in the early stages Taping to alter the mechanical stress and support the mid-foot may be beneficial for pain relief and recovery (Patterson 2006) Trimming 05 cm thick felt pad approximately 2cm square and taping it under the cuboid may help to support This is the area under the lateral border of the foot just behind the base of the fifth metatarsal Insoles and orthotics may not be tolerated unless relatively soft and flexible

# Lisfranc Fracture/Dislocation

This injury to the tarso-metatarsal joints in the foot may be associated with midfoot sprain If left untreated it may have significant consequences It presents with midfoot pain and difficulty weight bearing swelling on the dorsum Passive plantarflexion causes pain especially if rotated at the same time Lisfranc injuries are often missed even with an X-ray which is more definitive in weight-bearing position MRI or bone scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

A plaster cast with toe plate extending under the toes is applied below the knee to immobilise the joint Sometimes the bones require fixing with pins

# The Foot in Sport - Metatarsal Injuries

# The Foot in Sport

# Injuries to the Forefoot

# Metatarsal Injuries

Metatarsalgia is an inflammatory condition which occurs in the joints between the metatarsals and phalanges (MTP joints) usually in the second third or fourth MTP joints It typically presents with gradual onset forefoot pain exacerbated by weight bearing (Cohen 2007) Inferior palpation pressure or flexion of the MTP joint elicits pain Sometimes the metatarsal head (MTP) descends or ‘drops’ causing focal weight bearing pressure A high arched semi-rigid foot with tight extensor tendons of the toes may increase the potential for metatarsalgia A short first metatarsal causing increased compensatory pressure through the second metatarsal is referred to as Morton’s metatarsalgia X-ray may show degree of joint degeneration which will reduce improvement outcomes

Metatarsal injuries are particularly prevalent in sports where there is repeated twisting on the ball of the foot such as golf and squash (Nunan and Giesy 1997) Pain is induced by squeezing the forefoot or pressing between the metatarsals on the dorsal aspect

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

A ‘metatarsal pad’ which elevates and spreads the metatarsals may reduce pressure on the nerve (Kang et al 2006) These can be incorporated into an orthotics device Circumferential taping of the foot although compressive may relieve pain and pressure on the nerve by altering active posture and reducing mechanical compression There is little evidence to suggest specific foot exercises influence symptoms (Headlee et al 2008) Decompression operation has been successful in stubborn cases

# Metatarsal Fractures

The metatarsals can be fractured through direct impact from for example solid ground or football studs (Reeder et al 1996) If the bones are not

# Further Treatment and Rehabilitation

Anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation but should only be short-term temporary measure Material insoles or orthotics to protect and dissipate pressure can be applied (Kang et al 2006) Anti-inflammatory or ‘lubricating’ injections into the joint have been successful in chronic cases (Courtney and Doherty 2005)

# Neural Signs

The metatarsal bones sometimes appear to compress the nerve between the metatarsal bones causing it to be painful or leading to sensory loss particularly between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals This may be caused by benign mass (neuroma) on the plantar digital nerve between the toes Narrow close-fitting shoes like sprinting spikes sometimes appear to compress the nerve between the metatarsals

# Injuries to the Forefoot

note 

# Injuries to the Forefoot

# Stress Fractures

When stress fracture is displaced short cast or boot should be fitted for the first three weeks After six weeks the foot should be X-rayed again to ensure it has healed before gradual return to sport can start

More often there is gradual onset causing stress fracture (Weinfeld et al 1997) According to Prentice and Arnheim (2005) this type of injury most commonly occurs due to structural deformities of the foot changes in training surfaces training errors or wearing inappropriate shoes Additional causes may include sudden change in training patterns hill running running on hard surfaces or increasing the amount of mileage

The second third and fourth metatarsals are the most susceptible (Brukner et al 1999) When the second toe is longer than the first there is an increased risk of damage or fracture of the second metatarsal sometimes classified as ‘Frieberg’s disease’ which on X-ray appears as flattening of the metatarsal head and epiphysis It tends to include damage to the articular surfaces (osteochondroses) and most commonly occurs in females between ages 11 and 17

The increased loading of high-heeled shoes may be another predisposing factor plus it is very common that athletes wear shoes that are too small increasing compression on the toe (Farber 2007) When it is first noticed there is usually gradual onset pain and restricted movement at the joint made worse with movement There may also be swelling and tenderness in the area

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

A decrease in activity and occasionally brace or plaster cast may be required to allow recovery Insoles or orthotics can alter the weight-bearing load and assist recovery Surgical intervention is variable in procedure and success and is evolving

# Fifth Metatarsal Fractures

Fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal may occur as result of pivoting acceleration and deceleration but particularly twisting the foot and ankle The ankle inverts and because there is powerful ligament attached to the base of the metatarsal small bone fragment avulses This injury can be treated without surgery but walking should be in supportive boot initially

However if the junction between the base of the metatarsal and the shaft is fractured this particular area of the bone has poor blood supply and the rate of recovery is longer and may even require surgical intervention These fractures occur as result of twisting of the foot when landing for example in basketball and soccer players

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

It is important to differentiate between the acute traumatic fracture sometimes called ‘Jones’ fracture in the slower healing area of the metatarsal and the chronic repetitive fatigue stress fracture as management is significantly different (Fetzer and Wright 2006) Although surgery can now be more readily considered after small puncture in the skin and possibly bone graft and added blood cells to promote healing pin is put into the metatarsal across the fracture and athletes are allowed to mobilize and partially weight-bear in boot immediately following surgery which reduces stiffness and rehabilitation time (Casillas and Strom 2006)

Rehabilitation is an essential part of recovery maintaining mobility of the foot (Brukner and Bennell 1997) Exercise starting in single plane with bike elliptical trainer and hydrotherapy monitored according to swelling and discomfort progressing to full activities with twisting and pivoting by around 8–10 weeks

There may be some predisposition in the alignment of the leg and the foot particularly in genu varum or slightly bow-legged individuals incurring increased stress on the outside of the foot including the fifth metatarsal Also if the sub-talar and particularly talo-calcaneal joint is stiff the foot cannot adapt to uneven ground or leg to surface angles This combined with an unstable or loose ankle stress to the peroneal tendons and stress fracture of the fifth metatarsal are the result of repetitive inversion sprains There is evidence (Yu et al 2007) that using off-the-shelf foot orthoses with medial arch support may cause increased plantar forces and pressures on the fifth metatarsal thereby increasing the risk for proximal fracture of the fifth metatarsal Being aware of soreness along the lateral foot is important particularly following activity which usually dissipates by the following day Then reduction of stress by management can contain the situation and avoid further injury

# The Foot in Sport - Hallux Injuries

# The Foot in Sport

# Hallux Injuries

The big toe will sometimes deviate towards the other toes with the first MTP joint becoming medially prominent This ‘bunion’ can become quite painful with bone exostosis and enlargement medially and superiorly Predisposing often genetically inherited biomechanical factors like ankle eversion and pronation are significant Shoes that compress and rub against the first MTP joint may add to the pain experienced Padding to separate the first and second toes or dissipate the pressure around the medial joint will help temporarily More permanent relief can be obtained by orthotics or surgery in advanced cases

Sprain of the first MTP joint can occur with forceful extension of the big toe Artificial surfaces may cause this injury where the shoe grips more and extends the toe up further particularly in soft flexible shoes It is also common in barefoot sports like judo and dance (Kadel 2006) In repetitive situations over period of time the articular surface of the MTP joint or even the bone can be damaged There may be swelling and pain at the joint of the big toe and metatarsal bone in the foot Passively extending the toe upwards elicits sharp pain

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

Taping or bracing the joint coupled with firm soled shoe to restrict movement will help in the early stages Rest and sometimes crutches are needed to reduce weight bearing If pain does not improve an X-ray is prudent to rule out fracture Recovery from this injury can take several weeks It is essential to mobilise the toe passively with light activity in the later stages of recovery to reduce the onset of MTP joint degenerative stiffness called hallux limitus or potentially the even more restricted hallux rigidus In some stubborn cases injection has been considered beneficial in reducing secondary changes

# Hallux Sesamoid Injuries

Hallux sesamoiditis is manifested by pain beneath the first metatarsal head with weight bearing on the ball of the foot or with motion at the first MTP joint Common complaints include pain with jumping and with pushing off to run The two sesamoid bones are embedded in the Flexor Hallucis Brevis tendon which helps exert propulsive pressure from the big toe against the ground (Dedmond et al 2006)

The sesamoid bones absorb impact forces in the forefoot during propulsion through series of attachments to other structures in the forefoot Although they are separated by bony ridge on the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal head they are connected to one another by an inter-sesamoid ligament They are also attached to other tendons and ligaments in the forefoot

This complex of attachments enables the sesamoids to disperse some of the impact of the foot as it strikes the ground The connecting ligaments

# Physio Knowledge - Case Study 1

summary 
case-study 

# Case Study 1

The first MTP joint capsule and the sesamoid bones act as fulcrum providing the flexor tendons with mechanical advantage as they pull the big toe down against the ground during propulsion (Glascoe and Coughlin 2006)

Sesamoiditis typically develops when the structures of the first MTP joint are subjected to chronic pressure and tension leading to irritation and inflammation of the surrounding tissue It is common problem among gymnasts who put constant force on the ball of the bare or relatively unprotected foot Repeated stress to the sesamoid bones may also result in fine stress fractures The pain usually begins as mild discomfort and increases gradually if the aggravating activity is continued building to intense pain with minimal observable signs although palpably sensitive The pain may limit the ability of the first MTP joint to dorsiflex causing restricted big toe extension and propulsive inhibition

Sesamoid fracture usually results from traumatic injury to the ball of the foot such as when the athlete lands heavily on the feet fracturing one or both sesamoids This produces swelling throughout the forefoot and usually bruise in the area of the big toe’s MTP joint X-ray may not be definitive as some people have bipartite (divided) sesamoids

# Treatment and Rehabilitation

If mild strict period of reduced weight bearing rest will suffice Insoles or pads with cut-out to reduce pressure on the affected area help recovery The big toe may be taped to immobilize the joint as much as possible and allow healing to occur More severe episodes may require oral anti-inflammatories below-knee boot for several days to weeks or an injection Sesamoid fracture involves keeping the injured foot immobilized and non-weight bearing for six or more weeks The first MTP joint must also be fully immobilized In persistent cases sesamoidectomy (removal) may be necessary but this can severely compromise normal foot function especially in sport and should be avoided

# Summary

To avoid significant foot and lower leg injury in sport requires the development of comprehensive incrementally progressive training plan Planning training programme requires preparation which stems from comprehensive assessment of physical needs The identification of structural problems and their management by appropriate footwear selection possible orthotic use and the maintenance of mobility stability and strength as preventative measure are significant parts of the athlete’s planning and injury prevention process (Whiting and Zernicke 2008)

Our lower limbs have evolved in such way as to allow us to perform complex activities absorb impacts and generate significant amounts of force The articulation of our lower limbs assists in force production and absorption through the use of angular momentum The coordinated combination of muscles levers and joints can allow us to kick ball sprint or jump high Altered biomechanics which may occur through foot injury influencing gait play role in the genesis of exercise-related lower leg pain (Willems et al 2005) and should always be considered in prevention and rehabilitation

Screening systems have developed that monitor fundamental movement (Kiesel et al 2007) The information gathered enables the development of potentially corrective exercise programs to positively influence individual movement patterns They are equally effective in general fitness and specific sports conditioning because they target the weak link in movement and may not only reduce injury susceptibility but improve athletic performance

# Case Study Details

A 26-year-old female elite middle distance runner presented with left foot pain around the distal dorsal foot which she had had for one month She had no causative trauma but had increased her mileage in training from two months prior to the onset of symptoms She described her pain as constant dull ache even when resting and at night which had been getting progressively worse

She complained of exquisite tenderness with flexion and extension of her left second toe She had tenderness to palpation over the dorsum of the distal second metatarsal and MTP joint She was able to walk but wanted to invert her foot to relieve pressure by putting weight through the lateral foot and avoiding extending the medial toes at push off There was dorsal swelling present proximal to and across the second to third metatarsals

# The Foot in Sport

# Case Study 1

Examination of trainers walking shoes and spikes revealed that they were too small and the second toe was compressed Damage to the second toe-nail and callus over the toe tip were also observed An X-ray revealed slight flattening of the second metatarsal head and joint space narrowing indicating Freiberg’s disease of the left second metatarsal head

# Initial Treatment Plan

- Firm orthotic insole with metatarsal bar and cut-out around the second metatarsal head to be worn as much as possible
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help relieve discomfort from peri-articular tissue swelling
- Firmer soled tennis shoes rather than running trainers One size larger than previous shoes
- Hydrotherapy as near daily as possible with deep water light contact running to maintain toe extension without significant loading
- No running and modified training to avoid propulsive movement but maintain aerobic fitness with increased weight circuits
- Existing weight training programme to continue

# Later Plan and Recommendations

- Larger shoes to allow normal movement without compression of the longer second toe
- Training to develop as symptoms allowed with progression in running in mileage and intensity
- Avoiding excessive braking uneven ground and hills to reduce biomechanical loading
- Passive mobilising of toe daily on waking to maintain movement before walking

The athlete was able to train fully and compete internationally three months from the first assessment Although symptom-free the athlete was warned there will probably be increased degenerative change in the joint in later life

# Case Study 2

A 38-year-old male triathlete with right posterior heel pain for three weeks after ‘half-ironman’ event presented with pain on palpation of the distal lateral Achilles tendon insertion Soreness was first noticed for approximately one year as low-grade irritability in the mornings particularly after longer cycles or runs and competitions Since the half-ironman he had been more aware of ‘lump’ on the back of his heel which was sore to prod and was uncomfortable when driving to the extent he had to change the shoes he used to drive He had noticed he was wearing his shoes down on the outside of the sole heel more than before

On examination there was palpable discomfort at the peak of proximo-lateral exostosis/bursa continuing superior into the Achilles The prominent osseous bursal projection in association with the Achilles enthisopathy was consistent with diagnosis of Haglund’s syndrome Talo-calcaneal joint movement was decreased in inversion and particularly eversion MRI highlighted bony prominence on the postero-superior aspect of the calcaneum It also showed high signal consistent with distal Achilles tendinopathy

# Initial Treatment Plan

- Initial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication followed by self-applied topical anti-inflammatory and dressings over the calcaneal prominence to protect until acuteness subsides
- The footwear he was wearing was changed for trainers with more motion control
- Off-the-peg insoles with more support were fitted to the trainers to replace the removable less supportive ones that came with the shoe
- Three-quarter length insoles with heel elevation to alter the relationship between the calcaneal bursal projection Achilles tendon and shoes were supplied for everyday lace-up shoes When the heel is elevated the plantar calcaneal pitch angle is adjusted

Decreases and shifts the osseous calcaneal bursal projection away from the shoe decreasing friction and irritation The reduction of pronation and assisted re-supination about the sub-talar joint axis also reduces frictional irritation

# Later Plan and Recommendations

- Mobilisation of talocalcaneal eversion to reduce proximo-lateral pressure and friction in shoe and decrease avulsing tension of lateral Achilles Tissue release techniques to maintain pliability of calf-Achilles
- Hydrotherapy as near daily as possible for foot and ankle stability plus early partial weight bearing eccentric emphasis exercises three times daily
- Full swimming training and slightly modified cycling programmes within discomfort levels
- No running but to maintain aerobic fitness with increased weight circuits Existing weight training programme to continue
- Prescription orthotics for increased control
- Alfredson’s eccentric regime to progressively strengthen the calf and Achilles
- Progress cycling programme to more hills with out of saddle conditioning
- Start progressive easy running alternate days initially straight line build-up interval runs progressing to longer intervals and then steady runs; avoiding uneven ground

The triathlete competed in an Olympic distance triathlon five months after the Ironman competition that caused the main exacerbation of symptoms still needing to protect the calcaneal prominence during the run with skin-like dressing He was advised to have someone passively mobilise the talo-calcaneal joint on weekly basis
