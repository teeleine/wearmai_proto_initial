# WearM.ai: Your AI Running Coach & Physio Pal! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§ñ‚ú®

Welcome to the WearM.ai codebase! This project aims to be a sophisticated AI assistant designed to help runners and athletes understand their performance, prevent injuries, and achieve their goals. By analyzing detailed biomechanical data, leveraging expert knowledge from sports science literature, and providing personalized insights through an interactive AI coach, WearM.ai strives to be your virtual physio and performance companion.

Built on a robust Django backend, WearM.ai integrates powerful Language Models (like Gemini, Claude, OpenAI via `infrastructure/llm_clients`), utilizes Weaviate for intelligent knowledge retrieval, incorporates grounding with academic sources via Linkup, and features a user-friendly Streamlit app for direct interaction with the AI coach.

## üéâ Features Galore! üéâ

*   **Deep Biomechanical Analysis:** Ingests and models highly detailed time-series data for various exercises (running, walking, jumping, squats, lunges, landing), including joint angles (Pelvis, Hip, Knee, Ankle), muscle forces (Soleus, Tibialis, Gastrocnemius), and gait phases (see the intricate `core/models.py`).
*   **AI-Powered Coaching (`services/llm_coach`):** Interact with an LLM-based coach (`CoachService`) that understands your profile, performance data, goals, and conversation history. It can:
    *   Generate insightful run summaries (`services/exercise_summarisation`).
    *   Answer specific questions about performance and technique.
    *   Provide personalized training advice and plans.
    *   Explain complex biomechanical concepts.
*   **Knowledge Base Integration (`infrastructure/vectorstore`):** Uses a Weaviate vector store populated with knowledge from sports medicine texts (processed by `core/management/commands/index_knowledge_base.py`) to provide contextually relevant information.
*   **Evidence-Based Grounding (`services/grounding`):** Employs Linkup (`linkup_retriever.py`) to search academic literature and fact-check AI-generated advice, ensuring recommendations are backed by scientific evidence (as guided by `services/prompts/llm_prompts.py`).
*   **Intelligent Context Retrieval (`services/llm_coach/coach_service.py`):** The AI dynamically determines (using `FUNCTION_DETERMINANT_PROMPT`) whether to fetch raw run data (`GetRawRunData`), generate summaries (`GenerateRunSummary`), query the knowledge base (`QueryKnowledgeBase`), or retrieve grounding data (`GetGroundingAndFactCheckingData`) based on your query and conversation context.
*   **Multiple LLM Support (`infrastructure/llm_clients`):** Easily switch between different Large Language Models (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI) thanks to a factory pattern.
*   **Advanced Text Segmentation (`services/segmentation`):** Uses various strategies (SDPM, Semantic, Late) via the `chonkie` library to intelligently chunk knowledge base text for effective vectorization.
*   **Interactive Streamlit UI (`coach_ui.py`):** A clean web interface for chatting directly with your WearM.ai coach, complete with streaming responses and status updates.
*   **Robust Django Backend (`core/`, `wearmai/`):** Manages user profiles, exercise data, conversations, and provides a structured foundation. Includes a highly detailed admin interface (`core/admin.py`) powered by `nested-admin` for data exploration.
*   **Utility Functions (`common/utils`):** Provides reusable tools for tasks like statistical calculations (`stats.py`) and text cleaning (`text_cleaning.py`).

## ‚ú® Key Components Spotlight ‚ú®

*   **`core/models.py`**: The foundation defining the incredibly detailed structure of biomechanical and user data stored in the database. Understanding this reveals the depth of analysis possible.
*   **`services/llm_coach/coach_service.py`**: The central orchestrator for the AI coaching experience. It manages conversation flow, determines necessary data retrieval actions (summary vs. raw vs. KB vs. grounding), constructs complex prompts, interacts with LLMs via the factory, and maintains conversation history.
*   **`services/prompts/llm_prompts.py`**: Contains the carefully crafted instructions (prompts) guiding the LLM's behavior, analysis, grounding requirements, and output structure. The `COACH_PROMPT` is particularly vital.
*   **`infrastructure/vectorstore/weaviate_vectorstore.py` & `core/management/commands/index_knowledge_base.py`**: This pair manages the project's external knowledge. The command processes, cleans, segments, and ingests text into Weaviate, while the service allows the `CoachService` to retrieve relevant information during conversations.
*   **`infrastructure/llm_clients/factory.py` & Specific Clients**: Enables flexibility by abstracting LLM interactions, allowing easy use of different models like Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI for various tasks (e.g., function determination vs. main response generation).
*   **`core/serializers.py`**: Essential translators converting complex database models into structured JSON (`UserProfileForLLM`, `RunDetailSerializer`) needed for the `CoachService` and LLM prompts.
*   **`coach_ui.py`**: Provides the user-friendly chat interface, demonstrating how to use the `CoachService` in a web application context.
*   **`services/grounding/linkup_retriever.py`**: Implements the crucial step of fetching evidence from academic sources to validate AI recommendations, enhancing trustworthiness.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Let's Get Running! üöÄ

Ready to bring your AI coach to life? Follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure **Python 3.11** (as mentioned in the old README) is installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd wearmai
    ```
3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:** (Highly Recommended!)
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Configure API Keys:**
    This project relies heavily on external APIs. Set the following as **environment variables**. Using a `.env` file is recommended (and ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`). **DO NOT COMMIT YOUR KEYS!**
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    *   `WEAVIATE_URL`
    *   `WEAVIATE_API_KEY`
    *   `VOYAGEAI_API_KEY` (For Weaviate vectorization if using Voyage)
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    *   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    *   `LINKUP_API_KEY`
    *(Verify exact names required in `wearmai/settings.py`)*

6.  **Set Up the Database:**
    ```bash
    python3 wearmai/manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a Superuser (for Admin Access):**
    ```bash
    python3 wearmai/manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your admin login.

8.  **üß† Vectorize the Knowledge Base: üß†**
    This command processes the knowledge base file (e.g., `wearmai/development/books/Sports Rehab Injury Prevention_clean.md`), cleans it, chunks it, and loads it into your Weaviate instance.
    ```bash
    python manage.py index_knowledge_base --debug
    ```
    *(Run this if you need to populate or update the knowledge base. The `--debug` flag provides verbose output.)*

You're all set up! Time to interact with WearM.ai.

## üéÆ How to Use WearM.ai üéÆ

1.  **Streamlit Web App (Recommended):**
    For the primary interactive chat experience:
    ```bash
    python3 -m streamlit run wearmai/coach_ui.py
    ```
    Or to avoid opening a browser tab automatically:
    ```bash
    python3 -m streamlit run wearmai/coach_ui.py --server.headless true
    ```
    Access the provided URL in your browser to chat with the coach.

2.  **Coach Service Demo (Command Line):**
    Run a quick test interaction using the `CoachService` directly:
    ```bash
    python3 wearmai/manage.py start_coach_cli --debug
    ```
    *(This script executes a predefined query using the main coaching logic.)*

3.  **Django Admin Interface:**
    Explore the raw data models and database contents:
    ```bash
    python3 wearmai/manage.py runserver
    ```
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser and log in with your superuser credentials.

## üìä The Data üìä

*   **Knowledge Base:** The source text for the AI's general knowledge is intended to be placed (e.g., in `wearmai/development/books/`) and processed by the `index_knowledge_base` command. The script currently references `wearmai/development/books/Sports Rehab Injury Prevention_clean.md`.
*   **User/Exercise Data:** Managed via the Django models (`core/models.py`) and stored in the configured database (`db.sqlite3` by default). The Django admin provides a way to view and manage this data.
